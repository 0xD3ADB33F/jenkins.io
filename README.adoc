This repository is currently *experimental* insofar that it does not actually
power anything. The goal here is to use link:http://awestruct.org[awestruct]
with link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] under the hood to provide a very
useful and compelling web presence for the link:https://jenkins-ci.org[Jenkins
automation server].



== Building

This project uses link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] to build, so as long as you
have JDK7 or later in your path, you should be able to build the site with:

    `% ./gradlew assemble`
