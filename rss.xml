Historically January has always been a very big month for the Jenkins
community. Between FOSDEM
Southern California Linux Expo  (also known as
SCaLE) we seem to hand out more stickers during the last week in January than
any other week of the year.


This year&#8217;s SCaLE 14X conference finally outgrew the LAX Hilton in Los Angeles,
where it had been hosted in years past, and moved over to the Pasadena
Convention Center in Pasadena California. While the organizers of the
conference expanded their scope, so did the Jenkins project!

&lt;p&gt;Historically January has always been a very big month for the Jenkins
community. Between &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://socallinuxexpo.org&quot;&gt;Southern California Linux Expo&lt;/a&gt;  (also known as
SCaLE) we seem to hand out more stickers during the last week in January than
any other week of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s SCaLE 14X conference finally outgrew the LAX Hilton in Los Angeles,
where it had been hosted in years past, and moved over to the Pasadena
Convention Center in Pasadena California. While the organizers of the
conference expanded their scope, so did the Jenkins project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our normal Jenkins stickers, we also had some special edition
stickers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Logo&quot;&gt;special
logos&lt;/a&gt; to give away this year, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superhero Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cute&amp;quot; Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninja Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accompany the stickers we also had both blue Jenkins and red &amp;quot;Angry Jenkins&amp;quot;
pins. Savvy Jenkins users might recognize &amp;quot;Angry Jenkins&amp;quot; from the Jenkins
server’s internal 500 page; fortunately however very few people that came by
the booth to say &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt; were familiar with Angry Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;talking-points&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;#talking-points&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Talking Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from talking about the cool stickers and pins, we spent the vast
majority of time talking about Jenkins to two groups of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who never had actually used Jenkins, even if they had heard of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;users who knew plenty about Jenkins but hadn’t actually heard about some of
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposals&quot;&gt;Jenkins 2.0 Proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, it seemed like most of the people that I talked to about &amp;quot;Jenkins
2.0&amp;quot; were pretty excited about the &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt; idea and starting to define
their &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/solutions/pipeline&quot;&gt;build processes and delivery pipelines as code&lt;/a&gt;
in their source repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly though, we spoke with many users about where Jenkins
is causing them pain or frustration. Speaking directly with users at events
like SCaLE or Jenkins Area Meetups is always fun, having a high-bandwidth
conversation about what we can do better and/or offering solutions/workarounds
to hopefully relieve some pain-points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one such case, a contributor approached me and complained that he had
emailed the developers&amp;apos; mailing list and frustratingly never actually received
a response. Comically enough, neither of us were able to find the email he had
sent the mailing list (whoops!) but because of the dynamic nature of booth-duty
at SCaLE, we got him squared away with a repository to contribute a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-charm&quot;&gt;Jenkins Charm&lt;/a&gt; for the Juju
configuration management tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jammin&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;#jammin&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jammin&amp;apos;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the booth-duty highlights was meeting a few folks who were interested on
starting a southern California Jenkins meetup. Over the days following the
conference, and a brief discussion on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/jenkinsci-jam/a071f664-30ab-44eb-b65f-a6f19cfbfdf5%40googlegroups.com.&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-jam@
mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, and the
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Los Angeles
Jenkins Area Meetup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to the meetup growing over the next couple months and
helping build a stronger local Jenkins community in Southern Califonia for the
other 51 weeks a year that SCaLE isn’t happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://socallinuxexpo.org&quot;&gt;SCaLE&lt;/a&gt; is one of my more favorite
open source conferences, the positive community in attendance, a kid-friendly
atmosphere (&amp;quot;Game Night&amp;quot; was a blast) and the broad spectrum of sessions
available make it a great way to spent the weekend in southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there again next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Planning is underway for Jenkins World, a major Jenkins event for developers,
release engineers and others interested in automation. The conference will be
held from September 13th to 15th in Santa Clara, California and is being
organized and sponsored in part by CloudBees.
Just like the "Jenkins User Conferences" before it, this year&#8217;s event will
feature many experts from the Jenkins community that help make Jenkins
the most popular open source automation server on the planet. We&#8217;ve found that
we outgrew the popular multi-city one-day Jenkins User Conferences, so unlike

feature many experts from the Jenkins community that help make Jenkins
the most popular open source automation server on the planet. We’ve found that
we outgrew the popular multi-city one-day Jenkins User Conferences, so unlike
previous years Jenkins World will be a three-day event in one place with an
incredible amount of great content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the event is to bring Jenkins contributors and users of all levels
together, from around the world, to discuss, share and learn from one another.
Starting &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; we’re opening the
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-cfp.herokuapp.com/events/jenkins-world-2016&quot;&gt;call for
proposals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As a global event, users from all over the world are encouraged to
submit a talk between now and &lt;strong&gt;May 1st, 2016 (11:59pm PST)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your amazing submission, and seeing you in Santa
Clara this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-cfp.herokuapp.com/events/jenkins-world-2016&quot;&gt;Submit a

&lt;p&gt;I believe strongly that we can make meaningful user experience improvements to Jenkins, but it will require having more weapons in our arsenal in terms of how we build plugins etc. This is what we’ll be talking about in this week’s office hour. It will be a developer-focused session where we’ll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools. We’ll also dissect and run some sample plugins that show these newer client-side dev tools in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the session will start 11am PST. Links to watch and participate will be posted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours&quot;&gt;Office Hours wiki page&lt;/a&gt; before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a guest post by Julian Kleinhans,
Software Architect at AOE, who is outlining some of the
Jenkins dashboard work he&#8217;s done with
dashing-js





Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them are really
beautiful and flexible enough from my point of view. For example, I could not
find a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data
should be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the
possibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do
with Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins
data. But I cannot do...

Jenkins dashboard work he’s done with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js&quot;&gt;dashing-js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them are really
beautiful and flexible enough from my point of view. For example, I could not
find a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data
should be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the
possibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do
with Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins
data. But I cannot do that with the existing built-in dashboards from Jenkins
plugins which are Jenkins-content specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid
re-inventing the wheel I also decided to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js&quot;&gt;dashing-js&lt;/a&gt; as a basis and not
Jenkins itself. dashing-js is a Node.js port of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dashing.io/&quot;&gt;Dashing&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinatrarb.org&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;-based
framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key features of Dashing are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt;, HTML and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widgets harness the power of data bindings (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://batmanjs.org/&quot;&gt;batman.js&lt;/a&gt;) to keep things &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt; and simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple Node.js script for fetching data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag &amp;amp; drop interface for re-arranging your widgets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage over a native Java-based Jenkins plugin is that you don’t need to
know Java and the whole Java stack. You can also easily add other pre-made
third-party widgets, for example a GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS
statistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent
of Jenkins. All you need is Node.js and the permission to access the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API&quot;&gt;Jenkins API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside dashing-js you will need my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/&quot;&gt;Jenkins Job widget&lt;/a&gt;. It is a
generic widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the
build status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it
is possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see
in the screenshot below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all you need is dashing-js, my Jenkins Job widget and some
&lt;a href=&quot;http://npmjs.org&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; packages.  The installation and the setup is really
easy and can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/images/blog/kj187_Dashboard_2_i4wkw6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to many other process and philisophical documents in the Jenkins
project, the document is not etched in stone and is therefore intended to be
updated. If you’re interested in participating in the discussion about this,
and other topics around how the Jenkins project operates, I invite you to the
&lt;code&gt;#jenkins-community&lt;/code&gt; IRC channel on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://freenode.net&quot;&gt;Freenode
network&lt;/a&gt; or to our regularly scheduled

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; first started working on the Jenkins
website, then called by a different name, I selected
&lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, an extensible content management system, to
get the job done. Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install
plugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal
has served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general requirements for something newer were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to edit and create content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to content should be tracked and reviewable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Jenkins contributor should be able to participate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support mixed content types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on
GitHub, would meet the majority of the &amp;quot;ease-of-use&amp;quot; type requirements. The
remainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years
ago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, commonly used by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, but the effort stalled as I ran
into challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,
events, pages, people, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://awestruct.org/&quot;&gt;Awestruct&lt;/a&gt;, a more
versatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoctor.org&quot;&gt;asciidoctor.org&lt;/a&gt;, I ventured down that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger
and switched &lt;code&gt;jenkins-ci.org&lt;/code&gt; over to the new site. In fact, the page you’re
reading &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt; was authored and published via our new
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io&quot;&gt;jenkins static site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page
there is a link titled &amp;quot;Improve this page&amp;quot; which will take you directly to
GitHub to edit this post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;amp;projectKey=WEBSITE&quot;&gt;tracked
in JIRA&lt;/a&gt;, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,
correct and create new blog posts and pages for &lt;code&gt;jenkins-ci.org&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io&quot;&gt;Check it all out on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For the past few years, a couple members of the Jenkins project have made the
trip to Los Angeles for the
Southern California Linux Expo.
Despite the name it&#8217;s a fairly broad open source technology conference and
since it is hosted prior to FOSDEM, it&#8217;s also a good
conference to get us in the open source mood after the holiday break.


Unlike previous years, when SCaLE was hosted at the LAX Hilton, this year it has
grown and moved to the
Pasadena Convention
Center. There, as with previous years, we&#8217;ll have a table in the expo hall with plenty of

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, a couple members of the Jenkins project have made the
trip to Los Angeles for the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x&quot;&gt;Southern California Linux Expo&lt;/a&gt;.
Despite the name it’s a fairly broad open source technology conference and
since it is hosted prior to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also a good
conference to get us in the open source mood after the holiday break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous years, when SCaLE was hosted at the LAX Hilton, this year it has
grown and moved to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/venue&quot;&gt;Pasadena Convention
Center&lt;/a&gt;. There, as with previous years, we’ll have a table in the expo hall with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/status/662718638135181313&quot;&gt;plenty of
stickers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; some other forms of swag available for devotees to
collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expo hall will be open January 23rd and January 24th, and a few Jenkins
contributors will be there to ask questions to, talk about CI/CD and hand out
stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; have a presentation on
Saturday, January 23rd titled
&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/continuous-delivery-infrastructure-jenkins&quot;&gt;Continuous
Delivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoteblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Talk abstract&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into
practice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage
and deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error
rate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means
less time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I’ll be highlighting some of the positive, and negative,
patterns used by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkins-infra&quot;&gt;Jenkins
infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; team to manage, test and deliver the Jenkins project’s own
infrastructure. Sort of a followup from my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqLGKa4QwA&quot;&gt;2014 PuppetConf talk&lt;/a&gt; about
migrating Jenkins infrastructure from masterless
&lt;a href=&quot;https://puppetlabs.com&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; to a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/index.html&quot;&gt;Puppet Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; oriented
installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the LA area, we hope to see you for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14&quot;&gt;SCaLE 14X&lt;/a&gt; in Pasadena!&lt;/p&gt;

On December 15, the Toulouse
JAM
was co-hosted with the Toulouse
JUG and Toulouse
DevOps. Indeed it made sense since Jenkins is
written in Java, makes use of Groovy code in many places (system groovy script,
job dsl, workflow…), and it also made sense to co-organize with the local
DevOps community since Jenkins is also a great tool to enable Continuous
Integration, Continuous Delivery and automation in general. There were 103
RSVPs, with 80 to 90 people in attendance.

There were 3 talks planned for the evening:

As I mentioned in yesterday's post, we're planning a "Contributor Summit" on February 1st, after FOSDEM 2016 (January 30th/31st), to focus on Jenkins 2.0. Since many of us are already planning, the Monday following the event turned out to be the ideal time to discuss 2.0.

Note: If you're not already familiar with some of the key proposals that were put forth, you can review them in the Jenkins 2.0 proposals summery page.

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/fosdem-2016-travel-grant-program&quot;&gt;yesterday&amp;apos;s post&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;apos;re planning a &amp;quot;Contributor Summit&amp;quot; on February 1st, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2016&lt;/a&gt; (January 30th/31st), to focus on Jenkins 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;ve hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203777932/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; Contributor Summits in the past, and they&amp;apos;re usually a day-long event where we try to gather a number of Jenkins core/plugin developers and active/power users to have detailed discussions around the theme of the summit. For this &amp;quot;Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit&amp;quot; we do not have a complete agenda yet, but we will post that to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/&quot;&gt;Meetup event&lt;/a&gt; once it is fully prepared in the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, we&amp;apos;ll be discussing a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;venue-and-rsvp&quot;&gt;Venue and RSVP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Contributor Summit will be hosted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudbees.com&quot;&gt;CloudBees&lt;/a&gt; office at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=Rue+des+Colonies%2C+11%2C+Belgium%2C+be&quot;&gt;Rue des Colonies, 11, Brussels, Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;apos;re already planning on attending FOSDEM, the office is near Grand Place and Cafe Delerium (where the Friday beer event is hosted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue is of limited size, so if you&amp;apos;re planning to join us, &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt; RSVP to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/&quot;&gt;the Meetup event&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you&amp;apos;re certain you will be able to attend. If you find yourself unable to attend, please remove yourself from the list to ensure that we can fit as many active contributors into the office as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

The first Jenkins meetup in Saint Petersburg, Russia took place on December
9th. The event has been organized with the help from Yandex and CloudBees.

In total there were about 80 attendees at the meetup. In addition to
meetup.com
the event has been promoted by Yandex so we quickly reached capacity limit.

There were 3 talks conducted, speakers from Yandex, ZeroTurnaround and
CloudBees. We discussed the current open-source project state, ongoing
activities in the community, Jenkins-powered CD case studies from
ZeroTurnaround and Jenkins plugin development approaches.

Although December is a short month due to the holidays, there has been a good
amount of local Jenkins activities that took place regardless of holiday
obligations. Today and tomorrow I will be doing a series of posts to summarize
December JAM World Tour. Special thanks to the JAM organizers and co-organizers
who made it all happen in these cities:


  Lima, Peru
  St.Petersburg, Russia
  Toulouse, France
  Bay Area, CA

&lt;p&gt;On December 9 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Lima JAM&lt;/a&gt;
hosted their first Jenkins meetup in Lima, Peru. There were attendance from
various roles of DevOps: Dev, QA, and Ops. There was also a good mixture of
different levels of Jenkins users, some were new and just starting to use
Jenkins while others had extensive Jenkins experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group has been invited by Docker and Ansible meetup organizers for a joint
event in January to showcase technologies from Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.
Congrats to Lima JAM group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides from the meetup can be found
&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/eddumelendez/peru-jam-intro&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Additional shared resources used in
the Lima JAM can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenkinsperu.github.io/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/pro/Jenkins/&quot;&gt;Jenkins Area Meetups&lt;/a&gt;

Thank you to Netflix for sponsoring the yummy
burrito bar and offered up their brand new auditorium to host Jenkins
Developers and Users Meetup group on Dec 16. We had 96 RSVPs which was
impressive. Our speaker for the evening was Akshay Dayal, Software Engineer at
Google. Akshay's session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided
to scale their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their
security/availability and failover requirements and how heavy automation played
an important role in this effort.

The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config data
externally. Slides are listed below. The video will be posted on...

While we are gearing up for FOSDEM 2016 early next year in Brussels, I wanted to remind the Jenkins community about our Travel Grant Program. We're a little late on mentioning it, but the board has allocated the money to help Jenkins contributors travel to Brussels to participate in FOSDEM and the Jenkins Contributor Summit which we will be hosting the day after, Feb 1st, which we'll discuss more in a later blog post.

For the FOSDEM Travel Grant Program, we are able to cover up to $500 (USD) in expenses to help community members participate in FOSDEM.

&lt;p&gt;While we are gearing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2016&lt;/a&gt; early next year in Brussels, I wanted to remind the Jenkins community about our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program&quot;&gt;Travel Grant Program&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;apos;re a little late on mentioning it, but the board has allocated the money to help Jenkins contributors travel to Brussels to participate in FOSDEM and the Jenkins Contributor Summit which we will be hosting the day after, Feb 1st, which we&amp;apos;ll discuss more in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the FOSDEM Travel Grant Program, we are able to cover up to $500 (USD) in expenses to help community members participate in FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;apos;re interested, please read the description of the program below. &lt;strong&gt;Please note that some of the details of the program are different from the linked grant program page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless we hope to see you all at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; on January 30th and 31st, 2016, in Brussels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eligibility&quot;&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All community members are eligible for support unless they&amp;apos;ve received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event&amp;apos;s date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we&amp;apos;ll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program&quot;&gt;Travel Grant Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board&quot;&gt;Governance Board&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;code&gt;jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;strong&gt;January 6th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The event you&amp;apos;d like to attend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plugins you developed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull requests you authored&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation you wrote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public presentations on Jenkins-related topics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why should we sponsor your trip?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applicants-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Applicants Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;apos;ve been selected for a travel grant, we&amp;apos;ll expect you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be available for a blog post about this program before the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help out at the Jenkins &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016&quot;&gt;stand at FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your schedule permits, we&amp;apos;d love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Code+of+Conduct&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, we recommend reviewing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/practical/conduct/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the trip, please submit a travel report to &lt;code&gt;jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com&lt;/code&gt; mailing list. This report should include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you accomplished at the event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you learned at the event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contacts you made&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other useful information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review. We will reimburse actually incurred costs up to the 500 USD limit.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of people are using the Workflow plugin, but as with any scripting environment, users often have to start from scratch and learn the same lessons and shortcuts that other users have already learned. While there are blog posts from developers and users in various places, and some samples in the Workflow plugin documentation, more examples and tips and tricks are always, always useful.

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Workflow plugin&lt;/a&gt;, but as with any scripting environment, users often have to start from scratch and learn the same lessons and shortcuts that other users have already learned. While there are blog posts from developers and users in various places, and some samples in the Workflow plugin documentation, more examples and tips and tricks are always, always useful. To help with that, we&amp;apos;ve created the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples&quot;&gt;workflow-examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; repository on GitHub, as a place to store community-developed Workflow scripts that can help new users get started, show how to accomplish some non-trivial goals, and find tips and trick for taking your Workflow pipeline to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository has four directories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docs/&lt;/code&gt; - documentation, guides, and more. Including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples/blob/master/docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md&quot;&gt;Best Practices document&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;apos;d love to see more contributions to that doc, as well as any new ones that would be helpful to Workflow users!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;workflow-examples/&lt;/code&gt; - general Workflow examples, showing how to use a given plugin with Workflow, quirks of the Workflow DSL syntax, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;global-library-examples/&lt;/code&gt; - examples of how to write code for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/cps-global-lib/README.md&quot;&gt;the Workflow global library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jenkinsfile-examples/&lt;/code&gt; - Sample &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#creating-multibranch-projects&quot;&gt;Jenkinsfiles&lt;/a&gt; or other Workflow scripts from SCM .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/hacksgiving-left-overs&quot;&gt;Hacksgiving&lt;/a&gt; some initial content was added, but not everything is covered yet, which is why I&amp;apos;m posting this - more is needed. We&amp;apos;d love to see your tips, examples, gotchas and more. If you&amp;apos;ve got Workflow scripts you&amp;apos;d like to contribute, please read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples#introduction&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; and send a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples/pulls&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.

We released Jenkins updates today that include important security fixes: 1.641 and 1.625.3. For detailed information about the security content of these updates, see the security advisory.

One of these fixes, SECURITY-95, results in possible problems in plugins such as Maven Plugin, Javadoc Plugin, and HTML Publisher Plugin, so make sure to read all about that in the wiki.

Please note that the update site may lag a bit behind. If you want to update as soon as possible, download the releases from our site....

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year some great new Jenkins features came out of the butler’s goodie bag - amongst them, the most important one being the ability to realize &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/06/kohsuke-kawaguchi-the-main-challenge-for-jenkins-is-with-itself/&quot;&gt;continuous delivery pipeline as code&lt;/a&gt;!
The features like Workflow Multibranch, pipeline-as-code (with a marker file that Jenkins looks for in your application’s SCM repository/branch, aptly named Jenkinsfile) are the foundations to making Jenkins super intelligent to automagically create workflows (rather, a CI/CD pipeline) to build your code and orchestrate the work required to drive your application from concept to delivery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workflow Multibranch feature (provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin&quot;&gt;workflow plugin&lt;/a&gt;) provides the following key abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic Workflow (job) creation in Jenkins per new branch in the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build specific to that child-branch and its unique scm change and build history.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic job pruning/deletion for branches deleted from the repository, according to the settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility to individually configure branch properties, by overriding the parent properties, if required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins pipeline-as-code (concept) enables you to maintain your CI/CD workflow logic in the project/application source code repo with no additional configuration to be maintained per branch in Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workflow script to build/test/deploy your code is always synchronized with the rest of the source code you are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To demonstrate the concept here&lt;/strong&gt; - Let’s use a basic Java Web application project with a Maven pom.xml as shown in the structure below (this is using GitHub as the SCM but you can do this on SVN or Mercurial too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo&quot;&gt;This project&lt;/a&gt; has a marker file for Jenkins in the repo - &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what&amp;apos;s a Jenkinsfile?&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo/blob/master/Jenkinsfile&quot;&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/a&gt; is essentially your Jenkins Workflow, a script, that defines the CI/CD pipeline logic for a project with steps to build/test/deploy etc. captured in various stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for our sample Java web application, a basic Jenkinsfile could be something like -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;node {
   // Mark the code checkout &amp;apos;stage&amp;apos;....
   stage &amp;apos;Checkout&amp;apos;

   // Checkout code from repository
   checkout scm

   // Get the maven tool.
   // ** NOTE: This &amp;apos;M3&amp;apos; maven tool must be configured
   // **       in the global configuration.
   def mvnHome = tool &amp;apos;M3&amp;apos;

   // Mark the code build &amp;apos;stage&amp;apos;....
   stage &amp;apos;Build&amp;apos;
   // Run the maven build
   sh &amp;quot;${mvnHome}/bin/mvn clean install&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just having this file in the source code repo root would mean that -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jenkins will automatically recognize this branch and create appropriate jobs by itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quick, 1-step code checkout using: “checkout scm” in your workflow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every time a new change is pushed to this branch, the branch is built and the commit status gets updated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the branch is destroyed in the repository, or if Jenkinsfile is removed, the corresponding job gets destroyed from Jenkins automatically (&lt;em&gt;You can retain these jobs and/or archive the builds for audit/compliance requirements using the retention property - Orphan Item strategy&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; there are various mechanisms to promote reuse of Workflow scripts, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/cps-global-lib/README.md&quot;&gt;Workflow Global Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;required-jenkins-configuration&quot;&gt;Required Jenkins configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’ve the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; and (v1.11 as of writing this blog) Workflow Multibranch plugins installed on your Jenkins instance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, ensure that other dependencies, like SCM plugins and build tools, are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Either SVN/Git/Mercurial (depending on your SCM)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitHub Branch Source Plugin (optimized to use the GitHub API and improve performance)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maven build tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create a new &lt;em&gt;Multibranch Workflow&lt;/em&gt; Job with configuration as shown below - mainly selecting the Branch Sources (Git, in this example) and providing the branch/repo URL with credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branch sources&lt;/em&gt; (Git) - &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo&lt;/code&gt; (or a repo where you’ve cloned this source code with Jenkinsfile)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave all other properties default and &lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll observe that Jenkins would perform Branch Indexing on that “cd” job folder and start the workflow for the master branch, with an automatically created new job, named master, under the “cd” folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow does a dummy step for application deploys to the environments in this sequence &lt;em&gt;Staging&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; Waits for manual approval -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;PROD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s create a new branch off of this master branch in your cloned git repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git branch newBranch&lt;/code&gt; (create a newBranch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git checkout newBranch&lt;/code&gt; (switches to newBranch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push --set-upstream origin newBranch&lt;/code&gt; (pushes newBranch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll observe that your Jenkins instance automatically picks up this newBranch and starts running the workflow (with the Jenkinsfile in this newBranch) to build/test/deploy the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, if you now delete this &lt;code&gt;newBranch&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;git branch -D newBranch&lt;/code&gt;), Jenkins will automatically remove the orphan Workflow job for &lt;code&gt;newBranch&lt;/code&gt;. You can retain these jobs even after the branches are deleted using the &lt;em&gt;Orphaned Item Strategy&lt;/em&gt; property in the main &amp;quot;cd&amp;quot; job’s configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we observed the following benefits of this pipeline-as-code approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall job definition is a script (Jenkinsfile)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calls your build tools and scripts for details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The build script can be versioned alongside project sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jenkins handles feature/experimental branches automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep less configuration in &lt;code&gt;$JENKINS_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dockerized-demo-environment&quot;&gt;Dockerized Demo environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the following docker image to run this demo with a preconfigured Jenkins environment and the sample job: &lt;code&gt;jenkinsci/workflow-demo&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;docker pull jenkinsci/workflow-demo&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This docker container includes Jenkins with Workflow and Workflow Multibranch plugins, a local git repo with the aforementioned Java web application and Jetty to demonstrate a continuous delivery pipeline of this application deployed and tested across multiple environments in the pipeline with an approval gate before promoting to PROD (like QA, Staging and PROD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;apos;s a &amp;quot;cd&amp;quot; job pre-configured as a multibranch Workflow job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch the docker demo as: &lt;code&gt;docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 9418:9418 -ti jenkinsci/workflow-demo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can access Jenkins on port 8080 and Jetty on port 8081 from localhost or the IP of your boot2docker/docker-machine environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demo container has a local git repo so you can clone: &lt;code&gt;git://localhost/repo&lt;/code&gt;. When creating new branches, each branch automatically creates a matching subproject in Jenkins and triggers the build for that branch. The workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checks out source code from the same repository and commit as &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Builds sources via Maven with unit testing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runs two parallel integration tests that involve deploying the app to ephemeral server instances, which get thrown away when tests are done (this is done by using auto-deployment of Jetty)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once integration tests are successful, the webapp gets to the staging server at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8081/staging/&quot;&gt;localhost:8081/staging&lt;/a&gt; (or your docker-machine/boot2docker instance IP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requires a human to Manually inspect the staging instance, and when ready, approves the deployment to the production server at http://localhost:8081/production/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we hosted our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015&quot;&gt;Hacksgiving&lt;/a&gt; event, a two-day virtual hackathon with a number of recorded sessions and plenty of pull requests submitted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; would say it was a success! I would like to thank everybody who took the time to watch, chat and present in the Hacker Hangout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hacksgiving-platter.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everybody has had time to recover from the turkey and travel, we have some videos of the sessions sliced out and ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recorded sessions, there were a number of notes captured with useful links associated with practically each session. You can find those notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-HacksgivingNotes&quot;&gt;at the bottom of the Hacksgiving page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; The following videos are all available in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot;&gt;YouTube playlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intro-to-the-jenkins-project&quot;&gt;Intro to the Jenkins project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session was hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;rtyler&lt;/a&gt; and meant to provide a cursory overview of where to get started with contributing to the Jenkins project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RV_VqY3H1II?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intro-to-plugin-development-workshop&quot;&gt;Intro to Plugin Development Workshop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session was given both days of Hacksgiving by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/christ66&quot;&gt;schristou&lt;/a&gt; and does a really great job of introducing the viewer to getting started with developing a Jenkins plugin with Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eUzYZZsNBIA?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workflow-qa-and-demo-session&quot;&gt;Workflow Q&amp;amp;A and Demo Session&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session was not originally scheduled, but some folks on the Jenkins &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; had some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; questions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jglick&quot;&gt;Jesse Glick&lt;/a&gt; jumped into the Hacker Hangout to help us out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-b4MdGAvUz0?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internationalization-live-coding--qa&quot;&gt;Internationalization Live Coding / Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another impromptu session, this time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/daniel-beck&quot;&gt;danielbeck&lt;/a&gt; hosting. In this session Daniel walks through a plugin he was working on for Hacksgiving and adds internationalization support while answering a few questions here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4UxVffTpf4A?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intro-to-the-new-static-site&quot;&gt;Intro to the new static site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking off day two of Hacksgiving, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;rtyler&lt;/a&gt; hosted a session on the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.io&quot;&gt;statically-generated Jenkins site&lt;/a&gt;. The new site will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for contribution to Jenkins documentation and blogs, by pushing everything through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1wMKQ70pEug?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plugin-developer-open-qa&quot;&gt;Plugin Developer Open Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the last session of Hacksgiving, hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abayer&quot;&gt;abayer&lt;/a&gt; and ended up being more like a casual discussion of the current status and future work in the plugin development ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0QI-gg-AqZY?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.



Taking a cue from the Adopt a Plugin program that Daniel wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a "virtual hackathon" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus Hacksgiving 2015 was created!

&lt;p&gt;Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hacksgiving-platter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a cue from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/adopt-plugin-0&quot;&gt;Adopt a Plugin&lt;/a&gt; program that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/daniel-beck&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a &amp;quot;virtual hackathon&amp;quot; to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015&quot;&gt;Hacksgiving 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was created!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;ll be hosting Hacksgiving &lt;strong&gt;Nov 23rd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Nov 24&lt;/strong&gt; from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/&quot;&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&amp;apos;t need to know Java to help!&lt;/strong&gt; We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a few goals for Hacksgiving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Documentationhacking&quot;&gt;documentation hacking details here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find some plugins which &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin#AdoptaPlugin-Whichpluginsarecurrentlyupforadoption%3F&quot;&gt;are up for adoption&lt;/a&gt; new maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Pluginstocleanup&quot;&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;!--break--&gt;
### Sessions to note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Schedule&quot;&gt;sessions scheduled&lt;/a&gt; that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:00PST/10:00EST (&lt;em&gt;15-30min&lt;/em&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtyler&quot;&gt;rtyler&lt;/a&gt; will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing&quot;&gt;contributors guide&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:00PST/13:00EST (&lt;em&gt;60min&lt;/em&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/christ66&quot;&gt;schristou&lt;/a&gt; will host a workshop titled &amp;quot;Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:00PST/13:00EST (&lt;em&gt;60min&lt;/em&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abayer&quot;&gt;abayer&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting a &amp;quot;Plugin Developer Open Q&amp;amp;A&amp;quot; session, so bring your questions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacksgiving is very &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt; structured right now, so if you&amp;apos;re interested in hosting a session please let us know in the &lt;code&gt;#jenkins-community&lt;/code&gt; channel or by signing up for a session on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Schedule&quot;&gt;the schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-participate&quot;&gt;How to participate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a virtual hackathon, we&amp;apos;ll be congregating and chatting in a couple of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;#jenkins&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; as per usual&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We&amp;apos;ll be hosting sessions and tutorials via Google Hangouts, see the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-HackerHangout&quot;&gt;hacker hangout&lt;/a&gt;* section on the wiki page up to date details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Via the &lt;code&gt;#hacksgiving&lt;/code&gt; hashtag on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also RSVP on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/&quot;&gt;meetup page!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you can join in the festivities!&lt;/p&gt;

It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted Atlanta JAM and Bay Area JAM. Many thanks to our sponsors: Ericsson, CloudBees, Blazemeter, NetRoadShow.

Here's a summary of what was discussed:

Atlanta JAM - Jenkins workflow and Docker to reduce friction in DevOps efforts.
Bay Area JAM- Performance testing strategies, incorporating performance tests into Jenkins workflows and the metrics that matter most for troubleshooting and diagnosing issues.

A look forward to November and December:

Hacksgiving
Barcelona, Spain JAM
Toulouse,France JAM

As usual, if you're interested in becoming an organizer or sponsor, here's how to get...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 2015-11-11 15:00 UTC:&lt;/strong&gt; We have released Jenkins 1.638 and 1.625.2 which contain a fix for this vulnerability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2015-11-11&quot;&gt;See the security advisory for more information about these releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 2015-11-06 03:55 UTC:&lt;/strong&gt; Included a updated mitigation script which doesn&amp;apos;t have a Jenkins boot race condition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today we received numerous reports about a previously undisclosed &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_%28computing%29&quot;&gt;zero day&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; critical remote code execution vulnerability and exploit in Jenkins core. Unfortunately the vulnerability was not disclosed to us ahead of its publication so we&amp;apos;re still working on more thorough fix. In the &lt;em&gt;meantime&lt;/em&gt; however, we wanted to inform you of the issue and provide a workaround which will help prevent this exploit from being used against public Jenkins installations, for future reference this issue is being tracked privately as &lt;code&gt;SECURITY-218&lt;/code&gt; in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack is mounted through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI&quot;&gt;Jenkins CLI&lt;/a&gt; subsystem, so the work-around is to remove/disable the CLI support inside of the running Jenkins server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the following Groovy script you can disable the attack vector in your Jenkins installations by navigating to “Manage Jenkins” and then to “Script Console”, or just go to &lt;code&gt;http://your-jenkins-installation/script&lt;/code&gt;. This only addresses the current running Jenkins process, in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to &lt;code&gt;$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy&lt;/code&gt; (create the directory if necessary, and the file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import jenkins.*;
import jenkins.model.*;
import hudson.model.*;

// disabled CLI access over TCP listener (separate port)
def p = AgentProtocol.all()
p.each { x -&amp;gt;
  if (x.name.contains(&amp;quot;CLI&amp;quot;)) p.remove(x)
}

// disable CLI access over /cli URL
def removal = { lst -&amp;gt;
  lst.each { x -&amp;gt; if (x.getClass().name.contains(&amp;quot;CLIAction&amp;quot;)) lst.remove(x) }
}
def j = Jenkins.instance;
removal(j.getExtensionList(RootAction.class))
removal(j.actions)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to &lt;code&gt;$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy&lt;/code&gt; (create the directory if necessary, and the file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of this script can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218&quot;&gt;in this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously announced on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-advisories&lt;/a&gt; mailing list we’re preparing a security release for this upcoming Wednesday which will include patches for both the latest and LTS lines of Jenkins core. The Jenkins Security team is working to include a fix for this previously undisclosed exploit in or before this planned security release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this exploit, join us in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23jenkins&amp;amp;uio=d4&quot;&gt;#jenkins channel on Freenode&lt;/a&gt; or ask on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-users&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-users@ mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For security researchers and hobbyists, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Jenkins, we have some disclosure guidelines &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories&quot;&gt;on this wiki page&lt;/a&gt; which will help us mitigate any discovered issues as quickly and safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to subscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-advisories&lt;/a&gt;), it&amp;apos;s the fastest way to get updates by the Jenkins Security team.&lt;/p&gt;

Preceding some of last week's Jenkins 2.0 discussions, there had been some threads on whether we should move Jenkins to require Java 8. The introduction of Java 8 last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the end-of-life announcement for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.

I wanted to answer the question "does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in...

&lt;p&gt;Preceding some of last week&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0&quot;&gt;Jenkins 2.0&lt;/a&gt; discussions, there had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk/0gO2V9UXy-8J&quot;&gt;some threads&lt;/a&gt; on whether we should move Jenkins to require Java 8. The introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/events/us/en/java8/index.html&quot;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt; last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml&quot;&gt;end-of-life announcement&lt;/a&gt; for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to answer the question &amp;quot;does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?&amp;quot; There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/&quot;&gt;anonymous usage statistics&lt;/a&gt;, we do have access logs from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;mirror redirector&lt;/a&gt; which might provide some insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jenkins hits the mirror network, it&amp;apos;s not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like &lt;code&gt;Java/1.7.0_75&lt;/code&gt;. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/major-jvm-versions.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.8.0&lt;/strong&gt;: 21,278,960&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.7.0&lt;/strong&gt;: 27,340,214&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.6.0&lt;/strong&gt;: 4,148,833&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually &lt;em&gt;fairly strong&lt;/em&gt;, which I didn&amp;apos;t expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we&amp;apos;re able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

With more than a thousand public plugins in the Jenkins community now, it should come as no surprise that some of them are no longer actively maintained. Plugin authors move on when they change jobs, or lose interest in the plugin, and that's fine. Plugins are hosted on the Jenkins project infrastructure after all, and when a maintainer moves on, others can continue their work.

&lt;p&gt;With more than a thousand public plugins in the Jenkins community now, it should come as no surprise that some of them are no longer actively maintained. Plugin authors move on when they change jobs, or lose interest in the plugin, and that&amp;apos;s fine. Plugins are hosted on the Jenkins project infrastructure after all, and when a maintainer moves on, others can continue their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major problem of course is that it&amp;apos;s often difficult to tell whether a plugin is still maintained (and there&amp;apos;s just not a lot going on), or whether its maintainer has lost interest. Most plugins don&amp;apos;t get released every few weeks, or even every few months, and still do their job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect plugins that aren&amp;apos;t actively maintained with potential maintainers, we recently implemented the &amp;quot;Adopt-a-plugin&amp;quot; initiative: We built a list of plugins that are up for &amp;quot;adoption&amp;quot;, and display a prominent message on the plugins&amp;apos; wiki pages. Anyone interested in taking over as a plugin maintainer can then contact us, and we&amp;apos;ll set you up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in becoming a plugin maintainer? Maybe one of your favorite plugins isn&amp;apos;t actively maintained right now. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin&quot;&gt;Adopt a Plugin wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for more details on this program, and a list of plugins that would benefit from your help.&lt;/p&gt;

This week we have featured a number of proposals for what we would like to see in "Jenkins
2.0", the vision of which is to make Jenkins users more efficient, productive and happy. We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the "inside-out" to today's topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.

Just to recap, so far we've reviewed:

&lt;p&gt;This week we have featured a number of proposals for what we would like to see in &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0&quot;&gt;Jenkins
2.0&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, the vision of which is to make Jenkins users more efficient, productive and happy. We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the &amp;quot;inside-out&amp;quot; to today&amp;apos;s topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to recap, so far we&amp;apos;ve reviewed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation&quot;&gt;Introducing a policy for API deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core&quot;&gt;Splitting Groovy out of &amp;apos;core&amp;apos;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center&quot;&gt;Pipeline as code front and center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one&quot;&gt;User experience improvements (part one)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of today&amp;apos;s proposal is captured in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31157&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31157&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which, like yesterday&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;, contains a few issues linked from it with more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the problem aiming to be solved is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a new user installs Jenkins, they are greeted with the main, empty, dashboard which suggests that they &amp;quot;create jobs.&amp;quot; This makes no mention of plugins or the configuration options that are relevant to helping the user make Jenkins match their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past and current versions of Jenkins, if you know what you&amp;apos;re looking for it&amp;apos;s relatively easy to move around the interface. If you&amp;apos;ve never used Jenkins before, it can be very challenging to find your way around or even know &lt;em&gt;what it is possible&lt;/em&gt; to do with Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes aim to address this initial confusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead of changing the post-install defaults, which may not properly represent the user&amp;apos;s needs, the first-time user experience should help guide the user through configuration and plugin installation quickly so they can use Jenkins for their needs. Effectively it should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a good configuration for their usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins contributor &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tfennelly&quot;&gt;Tom Fennelly&lt;/a&gt;, who has led this discussion on the mailing lists in the past, has posted a good prototype screencast of what some of this might entail:&lt;/p&gt;

Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:


  Introducing a policy for API deprecation
  Splitting Groovy out of 'core'
  Pipeline as code front and center

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UX improvements being proposed aren&amp;apos;t necessarily as uniform as the proposals from earlier in the week but represent a large amount of prototype and exploratory work done by folks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tfennelly&quot;&gt;Tom Fennelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gusreiber&quot;&gt;Gus Reiber&lt;/a&gt; and a few others. Those following the dev list may have already seen some of these proposals in some of the &amp;quot;mega threads&amp;quot; that we have had discussing potential UI/UX improvements previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvements proposed for 2.0 can be found under &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31156&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The most promising proposal under this issue is to update the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9802&quot;&gt;plugin manager experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9vPUMe3lzfo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jf5s0sqIYBY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very important proposal for 2.0 worth mentioning is the proposal to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21092&quot;&gt;update UI work well on mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0&quot;&gt;Jenkins

&lt;p&gt;Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation&quot;&gt;Introducing a policy for API deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core&quot;&gt;Splitting Groovy out of &amp;apos;core&amp;apos;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s proposal comes from project founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kohsuke&quot;&gt;Kohsuke Kawaguchi&lt;/a&gt; titled &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;Pipeline as code front and center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and represents perhaps the most important and dramatic shift we hope to make in Jenkins 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality has existed through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin&quot;&gt;workflow plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which we have discussed at various Jenkins events before but if you&amp;apos;re not aware of some of the power behind it, check out this presentation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jglick&quot;&gt;Jesse Glick&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2pZdzaaCXg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31152&lt;/a&gt; expands on the problem we aim to address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The default interaction model with Jenkins has been very web UI driven, requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the details through a web browser. This requires large amounts of effort to create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job configurations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Introduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;lets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;stores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt; in your SCM&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;makes it automatic to set up new pipelines when &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt; is added&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;differentiates multiple branches in the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kohsuke&amp;apos;s proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already existing pieces together to provide a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; compelling experience for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal is so exciting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-feedback&quot;&gt;Providing Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31152&lt;/a&gt;, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide
feedback if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever logged in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, you have a &amp;quot;Jenkins user account&amp;quot; which

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

As I mentioned in yesterday's post, there's been a lot of discussion recently about what "Jenkins
2.0" means. In a recent "Office Hours" session, Kohsuke Kawaguchi presented his
vision for Jenkins 2.0 in a office
hours session, the slides for
which can be found in this Google
Presentation.
Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke's vision, 2.0 is primarily about making things
better for the thousands of users out there.

This week, we'll be reviewing some key areas of the "Jenkins 2.0" proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going

Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke&amp;apos;s vision, 2.0 is primarily about making things

&lt;p&gt;This week, we&amp;apos;ll be reviewing some &lt;em&gt;key areas&lt;/em&gt; of the &amp;quot;Jenkins 2.0&amp;quot; proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going
from Jenkins internals to user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far we&amp;apos;ve covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation&quot;&gt;Introducing a policy for API deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s post involves a proposal originally from community member &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jglick&quot;&gt;Jesse Glick&lt;/a&gt; who has proposed in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;JENKINS-29068&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://groovy-lang.org&quot;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; be split out from the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; Jenkins distribution. The linked issue expands on what the problem is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Currently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; for a variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were upgraded to a different major version, it may break users&amp;apos; custom scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split Jenkins&amp;apos; use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the library, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin depending on it (if first-class features themselves):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin developers, power and casual users alike. I encourage everybody to read through the proposal and its potential impact &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;on the issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-feedback&quot;&gt;Providing Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;JENKINS-29068&lt;/a&gt; and provide
feedback if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever logged in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue

&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, you have a &amp;quot;Jenkins user account&amp;quot; which

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for the rest of the week as we keep with our theme of going &amp;quot;from the inside out&amp;quot; and help us make Jenkins 2.0 great!&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past few weeks there has been a vibrant discussion happening on the
jenkinsci-dev@ mailing
list as to what "Jenkins

Jenkins does not currently adhere to semantic versioning,
the change of a major version number does indicate a major milestone for the community.

&lt;p&gt;This week, we&amp;apos;ll be reviewing some &lt;em&gt;key areas&lt;/em&gt; of the &amp;quot;Jenkins 2.0&amp;quot; proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going
from Jenkins internals to user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s post involves a proposal to introduce a policy for &lt;strong&gt;API
deprecation&lt;/strong&gt; from community members &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivergondza&quot;&gt;Oliver
Gondža&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/daniel-beck&quot;&gt;Daniel
Beck&lt;/a&gt;. Extensibility is the heart of Jenkins, but over the past ten
years we&amp;apos;ve not had a proper API deprecation policy other than &amp;quot;try not to
break plugins, ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel, expanding more on the problem wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have no backward compatibility policy besides &amp;quot;compatibility matters&amp;quot;.
With 1000+ plugins and basically the entire core being available to
plugins, a lot of difficult or impossible to remove cruft has accumulated over
the last ten years. This limits both what can be changed in core, and makes
documentation difficult to use for plugin developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two have put together a detailed proposal under
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which
suggests we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;limit the availability in APIs (classes, methods, fields, …) provided by core
to a number of releases. Depending on the feature, this can range from a few
months, to a few years (e.g. two years being about 100 releases of Jenkins and
eight LTS baselines).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the entire proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;on the issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt;, where we are

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31035&lt;/a&gt; and provide
feedback if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever logged in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, you have a &amp;quot;Jenkins user account&amp;quot; which
means you&amp;apos;ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on
the issue linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt;: if you have forgotten your password, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/account/&quot;&gt;the account
app&lt;/a&gt; to reset it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, and help make Jenkins 2.0 great!&lt;/p&gt;

There's been some active discussions and planning around Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) specifically in the following cities:

Rennes, France 
Seville, Spain 
Seattle, Washington 
Barcelona,Spain
Raleigh, North Carolina
Atlanta, Georgia


I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!

Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you're interested in paying it forward, here's HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer....

This past Thursday, September 24th, 2015, I presented a couple of prototypes of what I hope will be the future of the Jenkins GUI. Or perhaps more correctly, close enough to the future to start generating positive feedback from you the community that improving the Jenkins GUI is important and some pieces that I am showing are going in the right direction. If you have ~45 minutes to spare, I recommend the video (the narrator's voice is very soothing). If not, I offer the following as a reasonable summary.

&lt;p&gt;This past Thursday, September 24th, 2015, I presented a couple of prototypes of what I hope will be the future of the Jenkins GUI. Or perhaps more correctly, close enough to the future to start generating positive feedback from you the community that improving the Jenkins GUI is important and some pieces that I am showing are going in the right direction. If you have ~45 minutes to spare, I recommend the video (the narrator&amp;apos;s voice is very soothing). If not, I offer the following as a reasonable summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins has a lot of strengths as tool. Its robust user community along with its thoughtful and extensible design are two of the most immediate. They are the two pillars that have made Jenkins the leader in the CD/CI space and the de facto choice for most of us looking to automate our build and test processes. But let&amp;apos;s face it, by today&amp;apos;s standards, the GUI doesn&amp;apos;t really sing. I will even go so far as to say, I believe it is a platform liability at the moment, and even among we the Jenkins faithful, few of us look forward to using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to turn that tide, I traveled to this year&amp;apos;s 3 main JUC events, in DC, London, and Santa Clara, pushing the idea that enhancement is possible and providing an evolving sketch of what that might look like. The three main areas of enhancement I have targeted for a first round of improvement are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_lu-P0OhNQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Item creation and configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vPUMe3lzfo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plugin selection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/fja9nxXcykg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Workflow construction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Soon to follow, but not yet prototyped by me would be pieces dedicated to monitoring jobs in Jenkins as well as node and resource utilization and efficiency. Rightly or wrongly, I have started with the create and configure side of the GUI, as I see it as somewhat primary in a typical job creation scenario (you have to create a job before you can monitor it), but this second piece is no less important. Sadly, lips service is all I can offer you today, but more prototypes and video demonstrations are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Item Creation and Configuration in Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_lu-P0OhNQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most use cases, item creation means creating a freestyle job, so that is what I use as my base use case example. It is important to note, however, that most configuration in Jenkins happens through a shared set of GUI components. These components are a blend of Jelly files and Javascript and can be found in the .../main/resources/lib/form directory in the Jenkins source code. In operating on these pieces, I have the opportunity to effectively enhance broad areas of the Jenkins experience, including aspects of plugin use that share these components. This greatly increases the upside of the effort as well as the possible drama and side effects, which I will go into more detail on later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the upside piece, the first bit of improvement I am looking to attain is breaking up the many &amp;apos;toilet paper&amp;apos; style unbroken configuration lists sprinkled throughout Jenkins. The first example of this appears in item creation. On first installation, this issue is not immediately obvious, but if you have installed a variety of plugins or chosen to purchase CloudBee&amp;apos;s Jenkins Enterprise product, you will find that Jenkins can have quite a few types of items to create. While they do have descriptive text, I still find them difficult to differentiate and almost impossible to casually scan. Thus, my first suggestion is to add some form of categorization to the item types. For this to function correctly, the GUI will need to be smart enough to apply the categories only when item counts are sufficient to justify them (if you only have 4 item creation types, it doesn&amp;apos;t make sense to have 8 categories with which to sort them). But if you are a long time Jenkins user with many plugins you may also know it is possible to have more than a dozen item types. So if nothing else, an extension point that allowed for the categorization of item types seems helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration form itself, it also can become incredibly long with few landmarks or visual differentiation points. As a remedy, I propose calling out and clearly boxing each of the existing configuration sections and making sure that their names are as meaningful as possible. As an added step, I make the sections collapsible. This allows the user to jump to specific points in the form and tuck other areas out of the way. In some cases, we can make specific sections open by link context or even by user context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugin Selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vPUMe3lzfo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential piece of the Jenkins experience is plugin configuration. Today, if you are looking to add plugins to your Jenkins environment, you are almost certainly using Google to find a 3rd party review site, collecting the name of the plugin you want and then either linking to it on this website, or filtering for it in the Plugin Manager GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither in the product nor on this website is there a particularly good resource for comparing plugins and evaluating which you might add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I am looking to add something akin to an application store experience to both this website and the product UI. You should be able to group sort and compare plugins by a variety of criteria, including author, installation base, and user review. You should also have a set of general use categories that fits user needs and expectations, rather than the free ranging labels that plugin authors have arbitrarily applied today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Workflow Script Builder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fja9nxXcykg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have a GUI that allows for a sort of Drag-n-drop assembly of Workflows. A major tenant of the utility of Workflows as opposed to Freestyle jobs is that they can be completely separated from the Jenkins GUI and stored in a source repository. None-the-less, with absolutely no GUI, there is little to guide the user who is looking to get started without a upfront learning investment. As it turns out, a Workflow/Groovy script is pretty straight forward, but you don&amp;apos;t really know that until you have made one. Also, Workflow allows for the orchestration of jobs across multiple nodes of hardware resources, making it a potentially involved little bit of configuration. Thus, my goal here is two fold. Allow the user to model a workflow quickly and easily and showcase a few of the more advanced features workflow enables. The result is this script builder. My hope is to host the prototype somewhere you all might be able to use it directly, but in the meantime, my hope is that my video pretty well explains how it works. Please take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fja9nxXcykg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; and post whatever comments you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;...and really send along feedback...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all things community related, please, please, send back whatever feedback makes sense. I can be reached via Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gusreiber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@gusreiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other places you can find me include, IRC (freenode/#jenkins) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+GusReiberUI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google+ (https://plus.google.com/+GusReiberUI)&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions and Answers from the talk:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How likely is it that any of these UI changes will make it into the core open source Jenkins? When would we start seeing them there?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most will be OSS. An exact schedule has not been determined, but most of it is still about a year away. Likely we will have an experimental wars for download along the way. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Is there anyway to determine which GUI attributes are contributed by which plugin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I take it that is a bit of a feature request? 
It came up at JUC West as well. Should be something that can be surfaced in the GUI. I agree, it would be helpful.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What is the difference between ANT and Jenkins?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ant is a good bit more bare-bones than Jenkins. In fact, you can add an Ant plugin to your Jenkins environment. You would typically use Ant to compile java source files. Jenkins orchestrates the fetching of the source files from some particular repository, the building of those files (often Jenkins uses Ant via its plugin to do this), running and reporting some suite of tests against that build, and then archiving or deploying the artifacts to wherever. Often times this requires navigating several computers with their own security constraints, so Jenkins helps you manage that as well.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What version of the Jenkins it is?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This isn’t available today, but I am building against 1.621-SNAPSHOT currently, but will upgrade with Jenkins to the coming December LTS.

I&amp;apos;m interested in seeing the list of 100 plugins that you mentioned (by Daniel?)
Me too. :^)  He and the community (which can be you if want to join IRC freenode.net/#jenkins and attend the hangouts and governance meetings: http://jenkins.ci.org )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
For IRC, I assume the server is freenode.net?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be any dashboard kind of feature for the build history in the new GUI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, I have been focusing on the create and configuration portion of the Jenkins UX as I see it as a barrier to entry for new users. The read/report/analyze half of the Jenkins UX I actually see as the portion with more long term value, as you tend to read more often than you write, so I am eager to jump in here as well.
....however, in its core today, Jenkins the tool seems to me to really want to see the world in the same context of flat XML files in folders as it actually persists its configuration data. To really make meaningful dashboards, it needs to be possible to query job configurations and build artifacts by a wide set of criteria that is not at all related to the folder in which the xml file happens to be stored. Also, some of the things you care about in the Jenkins universe are compute resources (masters/slaves/exactures). These are also not the same as config files in folders and need to be queryable as their own first class type of entity.

...so what I am saying with a lot of words is that I see the config piece as a somewhat more immediate and urgent fix. The broccoli of the meal, if you will. I will want to get that out as fast as possible to get it out of the way.  The reporting piece is actually the wine. At the moment, we are giving you Bartles and Jaymes in paper cups.

...so a lot of work is still needed there.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Have you investigated Google Polymer as UI components for jenkins UI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have not, but will now. I am actually quite a google fan-boy in much the way a lot of kids love Apple. (I also love Apple… being from Seattle, I even love MS). But, for the super near term, we are most focused on getting JQuery cleanly into core and Prototype.JS deprecated. Walk first, is my feeling.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Are there any tutorials on Jenkins workflow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jesse Glick or KK are better people to ask about that, really. They are also on IRC: freenode.net/#jenkins. Daniel Beck as well, might be a good person to ask. My little workflow demo is still really just fiction.

Will there be a &amp;apos;Expand All&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;Collapse All&amp;apos; buttons for the accordions in new configure GUI?  (I would probably inject one if not by default)
Yes. Also, they should be URL controllable so that they can be set by link or user context easily. Maybe they should also remember what you had open last? ...stuff to tinker with that really needs to be right.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 What impact does the UI changes have on job configuration behind the scenes? Is configuration still stored in XML format?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
None. The post string stays the same and from then on, Jenkins is Jenkins.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Can the create item screen be configurable?
At the moment, no, but ideally yes. It is still a big hand wave at the moment about how those categories are created, managed, and updated. The same categories ought to bubble back up when searching for the plugins to help relate what plugins generate what UI. I am hoping for guidance from the community.

How will workflow fit in with new UI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In some respects, the new configuration page is about enhancing the more traditional freestyle job and not workflow. However, the last bit of my presentation with the script builder is exclusively about workflow. The plugin manager is about plugins, so it would apply to both.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
How is a human notified for the wait for approval step in this workflow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So workflow approval can be done via the web GUI. But to get real notification, you would program that into your workflow Jenkins has a fairly large set of notification plugins. So you can use Jenkins to trigger email, or SMS, or HipChat, or Slack, or pretty much whatever. As these plugins are increasingly customized for workflow, you will get nice and nice workflow syntax for instantiating those actions. When my script builder is adopted, you would have a friendly button you could drag into the stage and it would notify you prior to the manual checkpoint.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Custom plugins still supported?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Though there is supported and supported. The highest level of support for a plugin would be a custom DSL for workflow that would make for streamlined syntax in workflow for interacting with that plugin via Groovy. But existing plugins do not need that level of support to be used within a Jenkins file / Groovy script. Instead, the syntax for accessing the plugin is likely to be more complicated.
….some plugins are freestyle specific, in which case, they no longer make sense in workflow.
….Daniel Beck or Jesse Glick are probably better suited to answering this question, however...
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be an improvement in performance with docker builds, sonar scanning? From my experience sonar takes 20+ mins with jenkins plugin where as it takes 3 mins with maven plugin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this times it is taking the GUI to render, or the actual build to run? I am not sure I am following the question exactly, but regardless, I am not well equipped to answer many questions about performance issues in Jenkins. I know of a fairly major performance issue specifically in the configuration form that I believe will be fixed in the new GUI, but that isn’t build performance, it is just form rendering performance.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
I like the graphical configuration. Thanks.  The scripting of a complex workflow looked a bit daunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cool. Yeah, my main and first goal is to get something out there that would allow folks to quickly sketch and deploy an actual working workflow that reasonably reflects an 80%ish use case. No GUI can ever be as fully flexible as a script, but I don’t think most people need the 95% case to get started and see the benefit of a versionable and robust config file format.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be any effort to make the UI mobile friendly for the admin on the go?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Absolutely. Especially on the TBD read/reporting end of the UI, but everything new needs to meet a reasonably high bar of device responsiveness. Today, the Jenkins GUI is just not responsive. Which is terrible.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 As a plugin developer do I need to change implementing the ui source from jelly or groovy to some other language/technique or will it be compatible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So you will not NEED to change from whatever you are doing, except if you have built a plugin GUI that has custom script that either relies directly on behavior.js, hudson-behavior.js, or the particulars of the existing DOM structure (you do something in the client that requires your or some other input to be in a particular TABLE TR TD DOM traversal path). 
...I believe 2 things are going to continue to happen at a faster and faster rate. New plugin authors are not going to want to write GUIs in Jelly and Prototype.js, but instead use some more modern client side MVC approaches like Angular, where the GUI interacts with a REST api instead of being a dom directly rendered from the server. It is a bit of a different mode of working than Jelly, and maybe slightly less direct, but it is a lot easier to find doc on how to do things with JQuery, Agile, Handlebars and the like, than it is to find doc on Jelly. And the responsiveness and breadth of gestures and controls in Jelly are already terribly behind what is now the main stream of web UI development. So I think plugin builders are, if they aren’t already, going to want better tools available to them.
      I also think that people are going to gravitate towards workflow or something similar. Since the UI for workflow is foremost a script, making a GUI for a plugin that works with it might be a fundamentally different beast.  ...depending on what the plugin is trying to do… So again, new plugins or even upgrading existing plugins to work with workflow are likely want a new technology set, not just because the existing Jenkins GUI is changing, but because new plugins will want to do different and better stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Are there connectors for other source control tools like CVS and Dimensions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am not sure exactly which connector plugins are already supporting Workflow or how deeply that support goes. Because Jenkins has plugins that provide access to these SCMs, you can use workflow to go and fetch those source trees. A greater level of support for workflow from these plugins would mean a more elegant workflow syntax for that interaction. At the moment, my GUI script builder is still fiction. My plan would be to add GUI buttons for whatever are the most popular SCMs and I will attempt to mask the syntax regardless of its clumsiness.
….the way I am constructing my initial prototype, there is already a reasonably clear extension point for adding buttons that generate some chunk of Groovy syntax when it is dragged into a stage. So I will add the initial set based on community feedback and then the community can continue to add their own.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 What are the compatibility issues existing plugin developers needs to be aware of?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For plugins that interact with freestyle jobs, or really most job types that aren’t workflow, plugin developers should expect the page DOM structure to change. If for whatever reason, they find they are busting into some custom script to traverse the DOM to compare 1 setting to another, that will break.
    Also, hudson-behaviors.js itself has a number of functions in it that do DOM traversing, like “findFollowingTR”. In some cases the signatures of those functions might need to change and the DOM structure that they return might also change. If a plugin uses what were meant to have been internal functions, they are likely to break.
    Finally, the page geometry is going to change. This may seem so superficial and obvious that, who cares, but sometimes changing a column width translates into an important part of a GUI being hidden or otherwise inaccessible. That ends up being as critical a break as any other.

...so to combat these points of possible breakage, we are going to be looking for a handful somewhere between 20 and 100 plugins that we will want to test against. We haven’t made that list yet, let alone run any tests, so that is really a critical next step.

For the plugin manager changes, I don’t see much if any of a braking issue, although I would like to add additional sorting and display power to the GUI, which means the GUI will need more metadata than currently exists, if the plugins want to take advantage of that new power in the GUI. This won’t break things, but plugin authors might want to go back to their plugins and fill in whatever the new bits of metadata end up being…. most likely they would be things like, richer descriptions, better category selections, and possibly icons.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
I&amp;apos;ve not seen a lot of Jenkins but what I had I didn&amp;apos;t really get, was awkward for all the reasons Gus mentioned.  This looks brilliant.  When can we have it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tom and I, and now our junior pledge, Keith (not actually junior at all, just more fit than me), are busily typing as fast as we can as well as lobbying the community that our vision is more or less a correct one. We have a very interesting initial plugin selection GUI that might make this years final LTS (which I did not demo), which is none-the-less a nice step forward for Jenkins. In it will be a lot of the JS library bundling that will enable most of what I have shown in this demo. Our hope is that with each LTS we will be able to push out an additional piece of the GUI puzzle. Likely starting with the job create and configure GUI, which would be the mid year LTS. I am hoping that a year from now this will be how Jenkins looks and acts.
….in the meantime, we are grappling with how best to push preview releases so people can play with it and send me hate mail.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Is there any way to test front end of Jenkins plugins? And will that improve too?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A major and almost blocking portion of this work used to be the custom and somewhat broken version of HTMLUnit that was in core, which greatly hampered including libraries other than Prototype in Jenkins and writing code using those libraries in some sort of testable way. Our new approach to rebuilding the Jelly controls which are the foundation of the Jenkins config page and in general are shared by all plugins that need to post data back to Jenkins, already have a testing strategy backed into our design. Those Jelly form controls are extensible in Jenkins today and would remain so. Our hope would be that any plugin adding custom controls would follow our same design and test pattern we are building in core.
….so that was a long answer, but the short answer YES! Today, building GUI parts into your Jenkins plugin is a bit of a mystery, where most people copy something they saw someone else did, hack it, and the only test is, well…. it worked for me. That is no good and a fundamental piece we are looking to change.
….still a long answer… 
Node.js and Jasmine are the specific tools we using.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What&amp;apos;s the estimated rollout date for this workflow feature?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The workflow feature is the newest concept I demonstrated, but in a lot of ways may also be the easiest to ship. As a script generator, exclusively, it could be hosted anywhere, and then you just paste your generated workflow script into the whatever existing Jenkins GUI better, submit into your source code.

….but at the moment, it isn’t actually on an official roadmap yet.
Assuming the response to it remain positive, I would expect that to change fairly quickly.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

Just as in past years, we are running a survey this year, to get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the Jenkins project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with individual bug reports and feature requests all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.

This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend over time. But we also wanted to bring in some questions around how you are using Jenkins and what other technologies you leverage such as Linux containers...

&lt;p&gt;Just as in past years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Jenkins2015&quot;&gt;we are running a survey&lt;/a&gt; this year, to get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the Jenkins project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with individual bug reports and feature requests all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend over time. But we also wanted to bring in some questions around how you are using Jenkins and what other technologies you leverage such as Linux containers and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey will close at the end of September and, if you participate, you&amp;apos;ll get to see the results first. CloudBees is sponsoring the survey and as an added incentive for us to fill it out, CloudBees has pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card (thanks CloudBees!). Information you submit is only going to be used by the community and not by CloudBees. So please take the survey and let your voice be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/09/jenkins-community-survey-your-chance-to.html&quot;&gt;Finally, there are laws that govern prize giveaways like this and Cloudbees has put up terms and conditions for this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Jenkins2015&quot;&gt;Take the survey here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most Jenkins masters with a distributed build configuration will leverage nodes that run a slave.jar to start a slave agent. Regardless of whether the slave.jar is launched through a Java Web Start or SSH launcher, the jar will be copied from http://yourserver:port/jnlpJars/slave.jar to the build node. Keeping this jar up to date ensures that it picks up the newest features in a more recent release, such as the self-restart feature to keep slave JVMs “clean” and to automatically reconnect to their master. Additionally, newer versions of this component may fix bugs or implement newer protocol versions with various improvements.

&lt;p&gt;Most Jenkins masters with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds&quot;&gt;distributed build&lt;/a&gt; configuration will leverage nodes that run a &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; to start a slave agent. Regardless of whether the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; is launched through a Java Web Start or SSH launcher, the jar will be copied from &lt;code&gt;http://yourserver:port/jnlpJars/slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; to the build node. Keeping this jar up to date ensures that it picks up the newest features in a more recent release, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/content/your-java-web-start-slaves-will-be-always-clean&quot;&gt;self-restart feature&lt;/a&gt; to keep slave JVMs “clean” and to automatically reconnect to their master. Additionally, newer versions of this component may fix bugs or implement newer protocol versions with various improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-version-column-plugin&quot;&gt;What is the Version Column Plugin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch methods designed to pull the latest &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16490&quot;&gt;are not always reliable&lt;/a&gt; and some launch methods don’t even try to update the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore it can be useful to see what &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; version is running on a given build node and take offline any nodes which fails to update to the latest version of the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Version Column Plugin allows Jenkins masters to do just this, adding a new column to the “Manage Nodes” view and a new option for version enforcement on the node configuration screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the Version Column Plugin, navigate to the list of nodes in your Jenkins instance by clicking &lt;em&gt;Build Executor Status&lt;/em&gt; in the executors widget below the side panel on the Jenkins home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the plugin installed successfully, you will see a new column simply called “Version”. This column displays the version of the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; that each build node is using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This column is simply displaying the versions, so enforcement of &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; versions will need to be configured elsewhere. To activate this, click on the “Configure” link in the node manager’s left-hand menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will then see a set of options for slaves. To activate version enforcement, check the “Version” box and apply your changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you update Jenkins, there’s a chance it’ll come with a new version of &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt;. Now if the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; on a particular slave doesn’t get updated automatically, the master will take it offline and show a warning next to the out-of-date slave’s version number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Version Column Plugin is available for download in the Jenkins plugin manager or from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/VersionColumn+Plugin&quot;&gt;its wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Last year's JUC West 2014 was packed with good gems of information – such as "how we did it" talks where the speakers shared their points of view on the tools they use for automating their pipeline. At JUC and other conferences I especially seek out talks about how others implement their Continuous Delivery processes.   At the upcoming JUC West 2015, it is my turn to share “how we did it” at Perforce. I will present my talk "Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.

I will present my talk &amp;quot;Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perforce.com/&quot;&gt;Perforce&lt;/a&gt;, we see Continuous Delivery as taking the proven technique of automation and expanding it to a solid set of practices that make the pipeline even more efficient. This includes empowering the product teams to own production and quality all the way from requirements to delivery, and moving from a central build and release team to a self-serve infrastructure to remove the &amp;quot;friction&amp;quot; in the workflow. These changes have allowed us to quickly, efficiently and reliably adapt our software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market, and changes to the business strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Cloud Native and the benefits to Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines

There’s a lot of discussion lately around Cloud Native. If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters? From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud Native and the benefits to Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of discussion lately around Cloud Native. If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/cloud-native-what-it-means-why-it-matters/d/d-id/1321539&quot;&gt;Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters?&lt;/a&gt; From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise. A few notable features include load balancing, application routing, cluster scheduling, and containerisation. Cloud Native also offers a significant advancement for building integrated pipelines to deliver software. Before we discuss these advancements, let’s consider the role of the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Containers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most influential components of Cloud Native is the container. At this point, containers are fairly ubiquitous and most developers have experimented or used containers. For instance, if you&amp;apos;ve pushed an application to Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services, you’ve used an container without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially containers were a place to automate the deployment and execution of your code, but over time customization became necessary to handle specific use cases. As a result, container creation now occurs earlier in the development and build phase. As applications are packaged within binaries and containers, validation of the application and container configuration needs to be validated before leaving the developer’s laptop. So what does this mean for the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CD Pipelines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers will tell you their role has expanded over the years as agile methodologies have changed the way software is engineered. Techniques like Test Driven Development (TDD) and CD pipelines encourage software teams to deliver higher quality code in every build. Of course, a good CD pipeline starts at the developer’s laptop. Building and testing the start of a pipeline requires the correct tools while preserving the developer’s choice of container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below demonstrates a simple CD pipeline. As you can see, the pipeline starts from the developer’s IDE and uses Cloud Foundry’s  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lattice.cf/&quot;&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;to provide a sandbox to validate the delivery artifacts. Lattice, based on Cloud Foundry’s container scheduler, delivers a small Cloud Native Platform that can be scaled up in the cloud or scaled down to a laptop. It includes a cluster scheduler, HTTP load balancing, log aggregation and health management for containers. Best part, it offers developer choice. Lattice provides support for both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/omeara-pic_0.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice’s flexibility makes it extremely easy to test how the application, which runs in a Docker container, will function in a Cloud Native environment. It’s also extremely helpful for developers engaged in a spike (prototype phase) where they want to push, validate and demonstrate code and let the platform handle the container creation, runtime environment and deployment artifacts via Cloud Foundry buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the CD pipeline beyond the developer’s laptop to deliver value to the organization will require additional tools like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-platform&quot;&gt;CloudBees Jenkins Platform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/&quot;&gt;Artifactory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;Pivotal Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. These enterprise build-and-deploy solutions help developers deliver to a Cloud Native platform and reduce the time to establish the feedback loop. If the enterprise maintains a Hybrid cloud strategy, these tools make it seamless to deploy across different cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers build more Cloud Native applications for Cloud Native platforms, it’s important to establish good tool chains and best practices early in the development phase. Interested to see these tools in action? Join us at Jenkins User Conference West on September 2nd to learn how I use these tools to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-01-1400&quot;&gt;Integrated Deployment Pipelines with Jenkins and Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/01-01-1400-bhattacharya&quot;&gt;a speaker at this year&amp;apos;s JUC Europe&lt;/a&gt; in London, and will give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1400&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1130&quot;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west&quot;&gt;JUC US West&lt;/a&gt; next week—and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

Developing Enterprise-Ready Plugins

My greatest surprise at JUC 2014 in Boston was how many enterprise Jenkins CI users had developed plugins for their own use. I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at Black Duck Software, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked...

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developing Enterprise-Ready Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest surprise at JUC 2014 in Boston was how many enterprise Jenkins CI users had developed plugins for their own use. I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackducksoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Black Duck Software&lt;/a&gt;, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked for it to also support maven builds and run on slaves, it was time for help from the engineering team, particularly the integration team I lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we developed four more plugins and overhauled the original one with the user community (aka paying customers) growing to &amp;gt;75 organizations, mostly large or really large development organizations. In the process, we received lots of feedback and discovered some Jenkins features we feel are essential for good plugin design for the enterprise. Let me share these insights so that you can consider them in your plugin development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Credentials Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plugins connect to our web applications and need authentication to utilize our SDK. The first plugins used username and password fields in every job configuration. That made tedious configuration work and stores the passwords in clear text in the configuration files on disk. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did wise up and started using the credentials plugin to manage username/passwords centrally and securely. It even allows setting authorization roles in such a way that the maintainer of a job can use the credentials without seeing the password. With that in place, our plugins are fit for banks and insurance companies and any other security-conscious organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support the REST API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Jenkins talks REST? We found it to be an easy way to create and update jobs. It is a really handy tool. The REST API is easy to script for all sorts of external interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, plugins need to do a little effort to support it on their part; yet it is almost trivial to do. So from our experience it should not be left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote a small Java program that reads, creates, updates job configurations, and can trigger job runs. It reads the jobs and commits them to a file for easy mass editing and updates the jobs afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our internal use case is to manage regression tests. We have medium-sized lists of jobs that run regression tests. With this tooling we can create a new set of jobs for a given plugin that runs against a new target server, that is, a server version under QA. It all happens in less than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made this part of our migration from our first plugin to its successor with all the enterprise capabilities, but incompatible configuration. Using the REST API and some more Java programs we can create a csv file / Excel spreadsheet with jobs that are configured with the previous plugin. The user can filter the list with the spreadsheet application as needed, and then use the resulting list as input to the batch upgrade tool. This makes the upgrade a gradual affair and not a tedious exercise in UI configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;UpdateSites Manager Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are developing plugins for in-house use, you have the option to install/update those through file upload. However, in an enterprise you likely have multiple Jenkins servers for different divisions, development groups, or regions. The notification of updates becomes tedious at best. Wouldn’t it be nice to run your own update site, so that your plugin(s) become discoverable in the “Available” tab of the “Manage plugins” screen? Wouldn’t it be a dream if available new versions show up automatically in the “Updates” tab, including Jenkins version compatibility check?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UpdateSites Manager plugin by IKEDA Yasuyuki is the answer to your prayers. It is easy to install, and the process to create and publish an update site is not too complicated and can become part of your Jenkins job building/releasing the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-02-1400&quot;&gt;my presentation at JUC 2015 West&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll share more details on how this makes a difference and how you can use these techniques to make your plugins enterprise-grade. As a bonus, I’ll show you how to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackducksoftware.com/vulnerability-plugin&quot;&gt;free vulnerability report&lt;/a&gt; for your Maven or Gradle builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join Me at JUC West to Discuss Building an Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine with Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.xebialabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JUc.png&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east&quot;&gt;a great event on the East Coast&lt;/a&gt; in June, now over to the West Coast for another exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/&quot;&gt;Jenkins User Conference!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;apos;ll be there for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west&quot;&gt;JUC West&lt;/a&gt; on September 2-3 with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xebialabs.com/&quot;&gt;XebiaLabs&lt;/a&gt; team, and am looking forward to talking to the Jenkins users, partners, developers and community members that will be coming together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At JUC East, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMZOnsEuums&quot;&gt;talked about the importance of Automated Testing&lt;/a&gt; in your Continuous Delivery pipeline, and I was really pleased by the number of interesting discussions and comments that came about as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JUC West, I&amp;apos;ll be taking a broader view, and will talk about building an &amp;quot;Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine&amp;quot; around Jenkins. I&amp;apos;m going to focus on the challenge of identifying and choosing solutions for the many &amp;quot;adjacent problem spaces&amp;quot; to Continuous Integration that you run into when trying to move to Continuous Delivery: artifact management, feature tracking, environment provisioning, deployment automation, test management, pipeline orchestration, production feedback and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;ll discuss some of the options available for each category, with a special focus on app deployment, test result management and pipeline orchestration. We&amp;apos;ll also present a couple of real-world Continuous Delivery Machine architectures, and analyze some of the motivations for each organization&amp;apos;s choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our users use XebiaLabs tools/products in combination with Jenkins to build out their Continuous Delivery stack. If you’re scaling out your Jenkins usage too, stop by the XebiaLabs booth to see if you can pick up some tips and to say hello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look forward to seeing you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1400&quot;&gt;at the event&lt;/a&gt;, or check the slides or recording we will post after the event. Hope to see  you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Fortunately, we had the binary logs from the 17th through the 30th. This means that though most data could be restored, some data from between the 15th and the 17th was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our issue tracker, that means that issues JENKINS-29432 to JENKINS-29468 were lost, as well as comments posted from about July 15 12:20 PM to July 17 2 AM (UTC). We know this thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-issues/topics&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-issues&lt;/a&gt; mailing list where the lost issues and comments can be looked up for reposting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We unfortunately don&amp;apos;t have such a record from our wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
