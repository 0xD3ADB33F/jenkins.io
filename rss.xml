We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what "Jenkins
2.0" is going to include, today we're discussing my personal favorite, which I believe will have a tremendously positive impact for years to come (not to be too biased!): moving the "Pipeline as Code" support in Jenkins to the front and center.

Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:

&lt;p&gt;We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0&quot;&gt;Jenkins
2.0&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is going to include, today we&amp;apos;re discussing my personal favorite, which I believe will have a tremendously positive impact for years to come (not to be too biased!): moving the &amp;quot;Pipeline as Code&amp;quot; support in Jenkins to the front and center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4242/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation&quot;&gt;Introducing a policy for API deprecation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4242/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core&quot;&gt;Splitting Groovy out of &amp;apos;core&amp;apos;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s proposal comes from project founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kohsuke&quot;&gt;Kohsuke Kawaguchi&lt;/a&gt; titled &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;Pipeline as code front and center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and represents perhaps the most important and dramatic shift we hope to make in Jenkins 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality has existed through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin&quot;&gt;workflow plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which we have discussed at various Jenkins events before but if you&amp;apos;re not aware of some of the power behind it, check out this presentation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jglick&quot;&gt;Jesse Glick&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2pZdzaaCXg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31152&lt;/a&gt; expands on the problem we aim to address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The default interaction model with Jenkins has been very web UI driven, requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the details through a web browser. This requires large amounts of effort to create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job configurations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Introduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;lets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;stores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt; in your SCM&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;makes it automatic to set up new pipelines when &lt;code&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt; is added&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;differentiates multiple branches in the same repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kohsuke&amp;apos;s proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already existing pieces together to provide a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; compelling experience for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal is so exciting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-feedback&quot;&gt;Providing Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31152&lt;/a&gt;, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide
feedback if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever logged in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, you have a &amp;quot;Jenkins user account&amp;quot; which
means you&amp;apos;ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote for, or comment on
the issue linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt;: if you have forgotten your password, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/account/&quot;&gt;the account
app&lt;/a&gt; to reset it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for a couple more posts covering proposals to improve the Jenkins interface and user experience!&lt;/p&gt;

As I mentioned in yesterday's post, there's been a lot of discussion recently about what "Jenkins
2.0" means. In a recent "Office Hours" session, Kohsuke Kawaguchi presented his
vision for Jenkins 2.0 in a office
hours session, the slides for
which can be found in this Google
Presentation.
Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke's vision, 2.0 is primarily about making things
better for the thousands of users out there.

This week, we'll be reviewing some key areas of the "Jenkins 2.0" proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going
from Jenkins internals to user interface.

&lt;p&gt;This week, we&amp;apos;ll be reviewing some &lt;em&gt;key areas&lt;/em&gt; of the &amp;quot;Jenkins 2.0&amp;quot; proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going

&lt;p&gt;Thus far we&amp;apos;ve covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s post involves a proposal originally from community member &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jglick&quot;&gt;Jesse Glick&lt;/a&gt; who has proposed in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;JENKINS-29068&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://groovy-lang.org&quot;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; be split out from the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; Jenkins distribution. The linked issue expands on what the problem is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Currently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; for a variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were upgraded to a different major version, it may break users&amp;apos; custom scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split Jenkins&amp;apos; use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the library, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin depending on it (if first-class features themselves):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin developers, power and casual users alike. I encourage everybody to read through the proposal and its potential impact &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;on the issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-feedback&quot;&gt;Providing Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068&quot;&gt;JENKINS-29068&lt;/a&gt; and provide
feedback if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever logged in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org&quot;&gt;issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, you have a &amp;quot;Jenkins user account&amp;quot; which

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for the rest of the week as we keep with our theme of going &amp;quot;from the inside out&amp;quot; and help us make Jenkins 2.0 great!&lt;/p&gt;

Jenkins does not currently adhere to semantic versioning,
the change of a major version number does indicate a major milestone for the community.

Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going
from Jenkins internals to user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;apos;s post involves a proposal to introduce a policy for &lt;strong&gt;API
deprecation&lt;/strong&gt; from community members &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivergondza&quot;&gt;Oliver
Gondža&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/daniel-beck&quot;&gt;Daniel
Beck&lt;/a&gt;. Extensibility is the heart of Jenkins, but over the past ten
years we&amp;apos;ve not had a proper API deprecation policy other than &amp;quot;try not to
break plugins, ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel, expanding more on the problem wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have no backward compatibility policy besides &amp;quot;compatibility matters&amp;quot;.
With 1000+ plugins and basically the entire core being available to
plugins, a lot of difficult or impossible to remove cruft has accumulated over
the last ten years. This limits both what can be changed in core, and makes
documentation difficult to use for plugin developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two have put together a detailed proposal under
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which
suggests we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;limit the availability in APIs (classes, methods, fields, …) provided by core
to a number of releases. Depending on the feature, this can range from a few
months, to a few years (e.g. two years being about 100 releases of Jenkins and
eight LTS baselines).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the entire proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;on the issue
tracker&lt;/a&gt;, where we are
trying to collect feedback/history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-feedback&quot;&gt;Providing Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;re asking you to read the proposal in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035&quot;&gt;JENKINS-31035&lt;/a&gt; and provide

There's been some active discussions and planning around Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) specifically in the following cities:

Rennes, France 
Seville, Spain 
Seattle, Washington 
Barcelona,Spain
Raleigh, North Carolina
Atlanta, Georgia


I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!

Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you're interested in paying it forward, here's HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer....

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Rennes-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Rennes, France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seville, Spain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seattle, Washington &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barcelona,Spain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com&lt;/a&gt; if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you&amp;apos;re interested in paying it forward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup&quot;&gt;here&amp;apos;s HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last week, the first Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM) took place in San Jose, CA on Wednesday, Sept 23.  What a way to kick off the first JAM other than to have Docker, John Willis as our guest speaker. John talked about immutable infrastructure and its benefits and role of containers.
 
Kohsuke discussed Jenkins Workflow, the motivation behind the same and latest features of Jenkins Workflow like multi branch support followed by docker use cases. The highlight of the meetup was definitely Kohsuke breaking the news about Jenkins 2.0 and his vision and motivation behind it.

This past Thursday, September 24th, 2015, I presented a couple of prototypes of what I hope will be the future of the Jenkins GUI. Or perhaps more correctly, close enough to the future to start generating positive feedback from you the community that improving the Jenkins GUI is important and some pieces that I am showing are going in the right direction. If you have ~45 minutes to spare, I recommend the video (the narrator's voice is very soothing). If not, I offer the following as a reasonable summary.

&lt;p&gt;This past Thursday, September 24th, 2015, I presented a couple of prototypes of what I hope will be the future of the Jenkins GUI. Or perhaps more correctly, close enough to the future to start generating positive feedback from you the community that improving the Jenkins GUI is important and some pieces that I am showing are going in the right direction. If you have ~45 minutes to spare, I recommend the video (the narrator&amp;apos;s voice is very soothing). If not, I offer the following as a reasonable summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins has a lot of strengths as tool. Its robust user community along with its thoughtful and extensible design are two of the most immediate. They are the two pillars that have made Jenkins the leader in the CD/CI space and the de facto choice for most of us looking to automate our build and test processes. But let&amp;apos;s face it, by today&amp;apos;s standards, the GUI doesn&amp;apos;t really sing. I will even go so far as to say, I believe it is a platform liability at the moment, and even among we the Jenkins faithful, few of us look forward to using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to turn that tide, I traveled to this year&amp;apos;s 3 main JUC events, in DC, London, and Santa Clara, pushing the idea that enhancement is possible and providing an evolving sketch of what that might look like. The three main areas of enhancement I have targeted for a first round of improvement are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_lu-P0OhNQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Item creation and configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vPUMe3lzfo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plugin selection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/fja9nxXcykg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Workflow construction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Soon to follow, but not yet prototyped by me would be pieces dedicated to monitoring jobs in Jenkins as well as node and resource utilization and efficiency. Rightly or wrongly, I have started with the create and configure side of the GUI, as I see it as somewhat primary in a typical job creation scenario (you have to create a job before you can monitor it), but this second piece is no less important. Sadly, lips service is all I can offer you today, but more prototypes and video demonstrations are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Item Creation and Configuration in Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_lu-P0OhNQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most use cases, item creation means creating a freestyle job, so that is what I use as my base use case example. It is important to note, however, that most configuration in Jenkins happens through a shared set of GUI components. These components are a blend of Jelly files and Javascript and can be found in the .../main/resources/lib/form directory in the Jenkins source code. In operating on these pieces, I have the opportunity to effectively enhance broad areas of the Jenkins experience, including aspects of plugin use that share these components. This greatly increases the upside of the effort as well as the possible drama and side effects, which I will go into more detail on later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the upside piece, the first bit of improvement I am looking to attain is breaking up the many &amp;apos;toilet paper&amp;apos; style unbroken configuration lists sprinkled throughout Jenkins. The first example of this appears in item creation. On first installation, this issue is not immediately obvious, but if you have installed a variety of plugins or chosen to purchase CloudBee&amp;apos;s Jenkins Enterprise product, you will find that Jenkins can have quite a few types of items to create. While they do have descriptive text, I still find them difficult to differentiate and almost impossible to casually scan. Thus, my first suggestion is to add some form of categorization to the item types. For this to function correctly, the GUI will need to be smart enough to apply the categories only when item counts are sufficient to justify them (if you only have 4 item creation types, it doesn&amp;apos;t make sense to have 8 categories with which to sort them). But if you are a long time Jenkins user with many plugins you may also know it is possible to have more than a dozen item types. So if nothing else, an extension point that allowed for the categorization of item types seems helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration form itself, it also can become incredibly long with few landmarks or visual differentiation points. As a remedy, I propose calling out and clearly boxing each of the existing configuration sections and making sure that their names are as meaningful as possible. As an added step, I make the sections collapsible. This allows the user to jump to specific points in the form and tuck other areas out of the way. In some cases, we can make specific sections open by link context or even by user context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugin Selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vPUMe3lzfo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential piece of the Jenkins experience is plugin configuration. Today, if you are looking to add plugins to your Jenkins environment, you are almost certainly using Google to find a 3rd party review site, collecting the name of the plugin you want and then either linking to it on this website, or filtering for it in the Plugin Manager GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither in the product nor on this website is there a particularly good resource for comparing plugins and evaluating which you might add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I am looking to add something akin to an application store experience to both this website and the product UI. You should be able to group sort and compare plugins by a variety of criteria, including author, installation base, and user review. You should also have a set of general use categories that fits user needs and expectations, rather than the free ranging labels that plugin authors have arbitrarily applied today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Workflow Script Builder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fja9nxXcykg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have a GUI that allows for a sort of Drag-n-drop assembly of Workflows. A major tenant of the utility of Workflows as opposed to Freestyle jobs is that they can be completely separated from the Jenkins GUI and stored in a source repository. None-the-less, with absolutely no GUI, there is little to guide the user who is looking to get started without a upfront learning investment. As it turns out, a Workflow/Groovy script is pretty straight forward, but you don&amp;apos;t really know that until you have made one. Also, Workflow allows for the orchestration of jobs across multiple nodes of hardware resources, making it a potentially involved little bit of configuration. Thus, my goal here is two fold. Allow the user to model a workflow quickly and easily and showcase a few of the more advanced features workflow enables. The result is this script builder. My hope is to host the prototype somewhere you all might be able to use it directly, but in the meantime, my hope is that my video pretty well explains how it works. Please take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fja9nxXcykg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; and post whatever comments you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;...and really send along feedback...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all things community related, please, please, send back whatever feedback makes sense. I can be reached via Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gusreiber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@gusreiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other places you can find me include, IRC (freenode/#jenkins) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+GusReiberUI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google+ (https://plus.google.com/+GusReiberUI)&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions and Answers from the talk:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How likely is it that any of these UI changes will make it into the core open source Jenkins? When would we start seeing them there?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most will be OSS. An exact schedule has not been determined, but most of it is still about a year away. Likely we will have an experimental wars for download along the way. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Is there anyway to determine which GUI attributes are contributed by which plugin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I take it that is a bit of a feature request? 
It came up at JUC West as well. Should be something that can be surfaced in the GUI. I agree, it would be helpful.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What is the difference between ANT and Jenkins?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ant is a good bit more bare-bones than Jenkins. In fact, you can add an Ant plugin to your Jenkins environment. You would typically use Ant to compile java source files. Jenkins orchestrates the fetching of the source files from some particular repository, the building of those files (often Jenkins uses Ant via its plugin to do this), running and reporting some suite of tests against that build, and then archiving or deploying the artifacts to wherever. Often times this requires navigating several computers with their own security constraints, so Jenkins helps you manage that as well.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What version of the Jenkins it is?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This isn’t available today, but I am building against 1.621-SNAPSHOT currently, but will upgrade with Jenkins to the coming December LTS.

I&amp;apos;m interested in seeing the list of 100 plugins that you mentioned (by Daniel?)
Me too. :^)  He and the community (which can be you if want to join IRC freenode.net/#jenkins and attend the hangouts and governance meetings: http://jenkins.ci.org )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
For IRC, I assume the server is freenode.net?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be any dashboard kind of feature for the build history in the new GUI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, I have been focusing on the create and configuration portion of the Jenkins UX as I see it as a barrier to entry for new users. The read/report/analyze half of the Jenkins UX I actually see as the portion with more long term value, as you tend to read more often than you write, so I am eager to jump in here as well.
....however, in its core today, Jenkins the tool seems to me to really want to see the world in the same context of flat XML files in folders as it actually persists its configuration data. To really make meaningful dashboards, it needs to be possible to query job configurations and build artifacts by a wide set of criteria that is not at all related to the folder in which the xml file happens to be stored. Also, some of the things you care about in the Jenkins universe are compute resources (masters/slaves/exactures). These are also not the same as config files in folders and need to be queryable as their own first class type of entity.

...so what I am saying with a lot of words is that I see the config piece as a somewhat more immediate and urgent fix. The broccoli of the meal, if you will. I will want to get that out as fast as possible to get it out of the way.  The reporting piece is actually the wine. At the moment, we are giving you Bartles and Jaymes in paper cups.

...so a lot of work is still needed there.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Have you investigated Google Polymer as UI components for jenkins UI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have not, but will now. I am actually quite a google fan-boy in much the way a lot of kids love Apple. (I also love Apple… being from Seattle, I even love MS). But, for the super near term, we are most focused on getting JQuery cleanly into core and Prototype.JS deprecated. Walk first, is my feeling.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Are there any tutorials on Jenkins workflow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jesse Glick or KK are better people to ask about that, really. They are also on IRC: freenode.net/#jenkins. Daniel Beck as well, might be a good person to ask. My little workflow demo is still really just fiction.

Will there be a &amp;apos;Expand All&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;Collapse All&amp;apos; buttons for the accordions in new configure GUI?  (I would probably inject one if not by default)
Yes. Also, they should be URL controllable so that they can be set by link or user context easily. Maybe they should also remember what you had open last? ...stuff to tinker with that really needs to be right.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 What impact does the UI changes have on job configuration behind the scenes? Is configuration still stored in XML format?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
None. The post string stays the same and from then on, Jenkins is Jenkins.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Can the create item screen be configurable?
At the moment, no, but ideally yes. It is still a big hand wave at the moment about how those categories are created, managed, and updated. The same categories ought to bubble back up when searching for the plugins to help relate what plugins generate what UI. I am hoping for guidance from the community.

How will workflow fit in with new UI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In some respects, the new configuration page is about enhancing the more traditional freestyle job and not workflow. However, the last bit of my presentation with the script builder is exclusively about workflow. The plugin manager is about plugins, so it would apply to both.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
How is a human notified for the wait for approval step in this workflow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So workflow approval can be done via the web GUI. But to get real notification, you would program that into your workflow Jenkins has a fairly large set of notification plugins. So you can use Jenkins to trigger email, or SMS, or HipChat, or Slack, or pretty much whatever. As these plugins are increasingly customized for workflow, you will get nice and nice workflow syntax for instantiating those actions. When my script builder is adopted, you would have a friendly button you could drag into the stage and it would notify you prior to the manual checkpoint.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Custom plugins still supported?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Though there is supported and supported. The highest level of support for a plugin would be a custom DSL for workflow that would make for streamlined syntax in workflow for interacting with that plugin via Groovy. But existing plugins do not need that level of support to be used within a Jenkins file / Groovy script. Instead, the syntax for accessing the plugin is likely to be more complicated.
….some plugins are freestyle specific, in which case, they no longer make sense in workflow.
….Daniel Beck or Jesse Glick are probably better suited to answering this question, however...
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be an improvement in performance with docker builds, sonar scanning? From my experience sonar takes 20+ mins with jenkins plugin where as it takes 3 mins with maven plugin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this times it is taking the GUI to render, or the actual build to run? I am not sure I am following the question exactly, but regardless, I am not well equipped to answer many questions about performance issues in Jenkins. I know of a fairly major performance issue specifically in the configuration form that I believe will be fixed in the new GUI, but that isn’t build performance, it is just form rendering performance.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
I like the graphical configuration. Thanks.  The scripting of a complex workflow looked a bit daunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cool. Yeah, my main and first goal is to get something out there that would allow folks to quickly sketch and deploy an actual working workflow that reasonably reflects an 80%ish use case. No GUI can ever be as fully flexible as a script, but I don’t think most people need the 95% case to get started and see the benefit of a versionable and robust config file format.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Will there be any effort to make the UI mobile friendly for the admin on the go?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Absolutely. Especially on the TBD read/reporting end of the UI, but everything new needs to meet a reasonably high bar of device responsiveness. Today, the Jenkins GUI is just not responsive. Which is terrible.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 As a plugin developer do I need to change implementing the ui source from jelly or groovy to some other language/technique or will it be compatible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So you will not NEED to change from whatever you are doing, except if you have built a plugin GUI that has custom script that either relies directly on behavior.js, hudson-behavior.js, or the particulars of the existing DOM structure (you do something in the client that requires your or some other input to be in a particular TABLE TR TD DOM traversal path). 
...I believe 2 things are going to continue to happen at a faster and faster rate. New plugin authors are not going to want to write GUIs in Jelly and Prototype.js, but instead use some more modern client side MVC approaches like Angular, where the GUI interacts with a REST api instead of being a dom directly rendered from the server. It is a bit of a different mode of working than Jelly, and maybe slightly less direct, but it is a lot easier to find doc on how to do things with JQuery, Agile, Handlebars and the like, than it is to find doc on Jelly. And the responsiveness and breadth of gestures and controls in Jelly are already terribly behind what is now the main stream of web UI development. So I think plugin builders are, if they aren’t already, going to want better tools available to them.
      I also think that people are going to gravitate towards workflow or something similar. Since the UI for workflow is foremost a script, making a GUI for a plugin that works with it might be a fundamentally different beast.  ...depending on what the plugin is trying to do… So again, new plugins or even upgrading existing plugins to work with workflow are likely want a new technology set, not just because the existing Jenkins GUI is changing, but because new plugins will want to do different and better stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Are there connectors for other source control tools like CVS and Dimensions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am not sure exactly which connector plugins are already supporting Workflow or how deeply that support goes. Because Jenkins has plugins that provide access to these SCMs, you can use workflow to go and fetch those source trees. A greater level of support for workflow from these plugins would mean a more elegant workflow syntax for that interaction. At the moment, my GUI script builder is still fiction. My plan would be to add GUI buttons for whatever are the most popular SCMs and I will attempt to mask the syntax regardless of its clumsiness.
….the way I am constructing my initial prototype, there is already a reasonably clear extension point for adding buttons that generate some chunk of Groovy syntax when it is dragged into a stage. So I will add the initial set based on community feedback and then the community can continue to add their own.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 What are the compatibility issues existing plugin developers needs to be aware of?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For plugins that interact with freestyle jobs, or really most job types that aren’t workflow, plugin developers should expect the page DOM structure to change. If for whatever reason, they find they are busting into some custom script to traverse the DOM to compare 1 setting to another, that will break.
    Also, hudson-behaviors.js itself has a number of functions in it that do DOM traversing, like “findFollowingTR”. In some cases the signatures of those functions might need to change and the DOM structure that they return might also change. If a plugin uses what were meant to have been internal functions, they are likely to break.
    Finally, the page geometry is going to change. This may seem so superficial and obvious that, who cares, but sometimes changing a column width translates into an important part of a GUI being hidden or otherwise inaccessible. That ends up being as critical a break as any other.

...so to combat these points of possible breakage, we are going to be looking for a handful somewhere between 20 and 100 plugins that we will want to test against. We haven’t made that list yet, let alone run any tests, so that is really a critical next step.

For the plugin manager changes, I don’t see much if any of a braking issue, although I would like to add additional sorting and display power to the GUI, which means the GUI will need more metadata than currently exists, if the plugins want to take advantage of that new power in the GUI. This won’t break things, but plugin authors might want to go back to their plugins and fill in whatever the new bits of metadata end up being…. most likely they would be things like, richer descriptions, better category selections, and possibly icons.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
I&amp;apos;ve not seen a lot of Jenkins but what I had I didn&amp;apos;t really get, was awkward for all the reasons Gus mentioned.  This looks brilliant.  When can we have it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tom and I, and now our junior pledge, Keith (not actually junior at all, just more fit than me), are busily typing as fast as we can as well as lobbying the community that our vision is more or less a correct one. We have a very interesting initial plugin selection GUI that might make this years final LTS (which I did not demo), which is none-the-less a nice step forward for Jenkins. In it will be a lot of the JS library bundling that will enable most of what I have shown in this demo. Our hope is that with each LTS we will be able to push out an additional piece of the GUI puzzle. Likely starting with the job create and configure GUI, which would be the mid year LTS. I am hoping that a year from now this will be how Jenkins looks and acts.
….in the meantime, we are grappling with how best to push preview releases so people can play with it and send me hate mail.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Is there any way to test front end of Jenkins plugins? And will that improve too?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A major and almost blocking portion of this work used to be the custom and somewhat broken version of HTMLUnit that was in core, which greatly hampered including libraries other than Prototype in Jenkins and writing code using those libraries in some sort of testable way. Our new approach to rebuilding the Jelly controls which are the foundation of the Jenkins config page and in general are shared by all plugins that need to post data back to Jenkins, already have a testing strategy backed into our design. Those Jelly form controls are extensible in Jenkins today and would remain so. Our hope would be that any plugin adding custom controls would follow our same design and test pattern we are building in core.
….so that was a long answer, but the short answer YES! Today, building GUI parts into your Jenkins plugin is a bit of a mystery, where most people copy something they saw someone else did, hack it, and the only test is, well…. it worked for me. That is no good and a fundamental piece we are looking to change.
….still a long answer… 
Node.js and Jasmine are the specific tools we using.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
What&amp;apos;s the estimated rollout date for this workflow feature?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The workflow feature is the newest concept I demonstrated, but in a lot of ways may also be the easiest to ship. As a script generator, exclusively, it could be hosted anywhere, and then you just paste your generated workflow script into the whatever existing Jenkins GUI better, submit into your source code.

….but at the moment, it isn’t actually on an official roadmap yet.
Assuming the response to it remain positive, I would expect that to change fairly quickly.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch methods designed to pull the latest &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16490&quot;&gt;are not always reliable&lt;/a&gt; and some launch methods don’t even try to update the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore it can be useful to see what &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; version is running on a given build node and take offline any nodes which fails to update to the latest version of the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Version Column Plugin allows Jenkins masters to do just this, adding a new column to the “Manage Nodes” view and a new option for version enforcement on the node configuration screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the Version Column Plugin, navigate to the list of nodes in your Jenkins instance by clicking &lt;em&gt;Build Executor Status&lt;/em&gt; in the executors widget below the side panel on the Jenkins home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the plugin installed successfully, you will see a new column simply called “Version”. This column displays the version of the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; that each build node is using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4242/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This column is simply displaying the versions, so enforcement of &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; versions will need to be configured elsewhere. To activate this, click on the “Configure” link in the node manager’s left-hand menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will then see a set of options for slaves. To activate version enforcement, check the “Version” box and apply your changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4242/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you update Jenkins, there’s a chance it’ll come with a new version of &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt;. Now if the &lt;code&gt;slave.jar&lt;/code&gt; on a particular slave doesn’t get updated automatically, the master will take it offline and show a warning next to the out-of-date slave’s version number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4242/sites/default/files/images/versioncolumn-plugin-screenshot-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Version Column Plugin is available for download in the Jenkins plugin manager or from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/VersionColumn+Plugin&quot;&gt;its wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Last year's JUC West 2014 was packed with good gems of information – such as "how we did it" talks where the speakers shared their points of view on the tools they use for automating their pipeline. At JUC and other conferences I especially seek out talks about how others implement their Continuous Delivery processes.   At the upcoming JUC West 2015, it is my turn to share “how we did it” at Perforce. I will present my talk "Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/event/juc/2014/san-francisco&quot;&gt;JUC West 2014&lt;/a&gt; was packed with good gems of information – such as &amp;quot;how we did it&amp;quot; talks where the speakers shared their points of view on the tools they use for automating their pipeline.

I will present my talk &amp;quot;Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perforce.com/&quot;&gt;Perforce&lt;/a&gt;, we see Continuous Delivery as taking the proven technique of automation and expanding it to a solid set of practices that make the pipeline even more efficient. This includes empowering the product teams to own production and quality all the way from requirements to delivery, and moving from a central build and release team to a self-serve infrastructure to remove the &amp;quot;friction&amp;quot; in the workflow. These changes have allowed us to quickly, efficiently and reliably adapt our software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market, and changes to the business strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Cloud Native and the benefits to Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines

There’s a lot of discussion lately around Cloud Native. If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters? From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud Native and the benefits to Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of discussion lately around Cloud Native. If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/cloud-native-what-it-means-why-it-matters/d/d-id/1321539&quot;&gt;Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters?&lt;/a&gt; From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise. A few notable features include load balancing, application routing, cluster scheduling, and containerisation. Cloud Native also offers a significant advancement for building integrated pipelines to deliver software. Before we discuss these advancements, let’s consider the role of the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Containers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most influential components of Cloud Native is the container. At this point, containers are fairly ubiquitous and most developers have experimented or used containers. For instance, if you&amp;apos;ve pushed an application to Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services, you’ve used an container without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially containers were a place to automate the deployment and execution of your code, but over time customization became necessary to handle specific use cases. As a result, container creation now occurs earlier in the development and build phase. As applications are packaged within binaries and containers, validation of the application and container configuration needs to be validated before leaving the developer’s laptop. So what does this mean for the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CD Pipelines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers will tell you their role has expanded over the years as agile methodologies have changed the way software is engineered. Techniques like Test Driven Development (TDD) and CD pipelines encourage software teams to deliver higher quality code in every build. Of course, a good CD pipeline starts at the developer’s laptop. Building and testing the start of a pipeline requires the correct tools while preserving the developer’s choice of container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below demonstrates a simple CD pipeline. As you can see, the pipeline starts from the developer’s IDE and uses Cloud Foundry’s  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lattice.cf/&quot;&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;to provide a sandbox to validate the delivery artifacts. Lattice, based on Cloud Foundry’s container scheduler, delivers a small Cloud Native Platform that can be scaled up in the cloud or scaled down to a laptop. It includes a cluster scheduler, HTTP load balancing, log aggregation and health management for containers. Best part, it offers developer choice. Lattice provides support for both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/omeara-pic_0.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice’s flexibility makes it extremely easy to test how the application, which runs in a Docker container, will function in a Cloud Native environment. It’s also extremely helpful for developers engaged in a spike (prototype phase) where they want to push, validate and demonstrate code and let the platform handle the container creation, runtime environment and deployment artifacts via Cloud Foundry buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the CD pipeline beyond the developer’s laptop to deliver value to the organization will require additional tools like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-platform&quot;&gt;CloudBees Jenkins Platform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/&quot;&gt;Artifactory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry&quot;&gt;Pivotal Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. These enterprise build-and-deploy solutions help developers deliver to a Cloud Native platform and reduce the time to establish the feedback loop. If the enterprise maintains a Hybrid cloud strategy, these tools make it seamless to deploy across different cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers build more Cloud Native applications for Cloud Native platforms, it’s important to establish good tool chains and best practices early in the development phase. Interested to see these tools in action? Join us at Jenkins User Conference West on September 2nd to learn how I use these tools to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-01-1400&quot;&gt;Integrated Deployment Pipelines with Jenkins and Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/01-01-1400-bhattacharya&quot;&gt;a speaker at this year&amp;apos;s JUC Europe&lt;/a&gt; in London, and will give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1400&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1130&quot;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west&quot;&gt;JUC US West&lt;/a&gt; next week—and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

Developing Enterprise-Ready Plugins

My greatest surprise at JUC 2014 in Boston was how many enterprise Jenkins CI users had developed plugins for their own use. I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at Black Duck Software, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked...

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developing Enterprise-Ready Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest surprise at JUC 2014 in Boston was how many enterprise Jenkins CI users had developed plugins for their own use. I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackducksoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Black Duck Software&lt;/a&gt;, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked for it to also support maven builds and run on slaves, it was time for help from the engineering team, particularly the integration team I lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we developed four more plugins and overhauled the original one with the user community (aka paying customers) growing to &amp;gt;75 organizations, mostly large or really large development organizations. In the process, we received lots of feedback and discovered some Jenkins features we feel are essential for good plugin design for the enterprise. Let me share these insights so that you can consider them in your plugin development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Credentials Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plugins connect to our web applications and need authentication to utilize our SDK. The first plugins used username and password fields in every job configuration. That made tedious configuration work and stores the passwords in clear text in the configuration files on disk. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did wise up and started using the credentials plugin to manage username/passwords centrally and securely. It even allows setting authorization roles in such a way that the maintainer of a job can use the credentials without seeing the password. With that in place, our plugins are fit for banks and insurance companies and any other security-conscious organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support the REST API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Jenkins talks REST? We found it to be an easy way to create and update jobs. It is a really handy tool. The REST API is easy to script for all sorts of external interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, plugins need to do a little effort to support it on their part; yet it is almost trivial to do. So from our experience it should not be left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote a small Java program that reads, creates, updates job configurations, and can trigger job runs. It reads the jobs and commits them to a file for easy mass editing and updates the jobs afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our internal use case is to manage regression tests. We have medium-sized lists of jobs that run regression tests. With this tooling we can create a new set of jobs for a given plugin that runs against a new target server, that is, a server version under QA. It all happens in less than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made this part of our migration from our first plugin to its successor with all the enterprise capabilities, but incompatible configuration. Using the REST API and some more Java programs we can create a csv file / Excel spreadsheet with jobs that are configured with the previous plugin. The user can filter the list with the spreadsheet application as needed, and then use the resulting list as input to the batch upgrade tool. This makes the upgrade a gradual affair and not a tedious exercise in UI configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;UpdateSites Manager Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are developing plugins for in-house use, you have the option to install/update those through file upload. However, in an enterprise you likely have multiple Jenkins servers for different divisions, development groups, or regions. The notification of updates becomes tedious at best. Wouldn’t it be nice to run your own update site, so that your plugin(s) become discoverable in the “Available” tab of the “Manage plugins” screen? Wouldn’t it be a dream if available new versions show up automatically in the “Updates” tab, including Jenkins version compatibility check?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UpdateSites Manager plugin by IKEDA Yasuyuki is the answer to your prayers. It is easy to install, and the process to create and publish an update site is not too complicated and can become part of your Jenkins job building/releasing the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-02-1400&quot;&gt;my presentation at JUC 2015 West&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll share more details on how this makes a difference and how you can use these techniques to make your plugins enterprise-grade. As a bonus, I’ll show you how to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackducksoftware.com/vulnerability-plugin&quot;&gt;free vulnerability report&lt;/a&gt; for your Maven or Gradle builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Join Me at JUC West to Discuss Building an Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine with Jenkins





After a great event on the East Coast in June, now over to the West Coast for another exciting Jenkins User Conference! I'll be there for JUC West on September 2-3 with the XebiaLabs team, and am looking forward to talking to the Jenkins users, partners, developers and community members that will be coming together.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join Me at JUC West to Discuss Building an Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine with Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.xebialabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JUc.png&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east&quot;&gt;a great event on the East Coast&lt;/a&gt; in June, now over to the West Coast for another exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/&quot;&gt;Jenkins User Conference!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;apos;ll be there for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west&quot;&gt;JUC West&lt;/a&gt; on September 2-3 with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xebialabs.com/&quot;&gt;XebiaLabs&lt;/a&gt; team, and am looking forward to talking to the Jenkins users, partners, developers and community members that will be coming together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At JUC East, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMZOnsEuums&quot;&gt;talked about the importance of Automated Testing&lt;/a&gt; in your Continuous Delivery pipeline, and I was really pleased by the number of interesting discussions and comments that came about as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JUC West, I&amp;apos;ll be taking a broader view, and will talk about building an &amp;quot;Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine&amp;quot; around Jenkins. I&amp;apos;m going to focus on the challenge of identifying and choosing solutions for the many &amp;quot;adjacent problem spaces&amp;quot; to Continuous Integration that you run into when trying to move to Continuous Delivery: artifact management, feature tracking, environment provisioning, deployment automation, test management, pipeline orchestration, production feedback and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;apos;ll discuss some of the options available for each category, with a special focus on app deployment, test result management and pipeline orchestration. We&amp;apos;ll also present a couple of real-world Continuous Delivery Machine architectures, and analyze some of the motivations for each organization&amp;apos;s choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our users use XebiaLabs tools/products in combination with Jenkins to build out their Continuous Delivery stack. If you’re scaling out your Jenkins usage too, stop by the XebiaLabs booth to see if you can pick up some tips and to say hello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look forward to seeing you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1400&quot;&gt;at the event&lt;/a&gt;, or check the slides or recording we will post after the event. Hope to see  you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our issue tracker, that means that issues JENKINS-29432 to JENKINS-29468 were lost, as well as comments posted from about July 15 12:20 PM to July 17 2 AM (UTC). We know this thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-issues/topics&quot;&gt;jenkinsci-issues&lt;/a&gt; mailing list where the lost issues and comments can be looked up for reposting.&lt;/p&gt;

Mobile is Joining the Party At This Year’s Jenkins User Conference

Consider this as a shout out to mobile app developers: You are invited! For the first time, there’s a mobile track at this year’s Jenkins User Conference to discuss the best ways to extend CI/CD to mobile application testing.

As agile practices take hold, enterprises are expecting more collaboration between dev and test teams. Dev teams are doing more testing while QA teams are becoming more skilled at coding.

&lt;p&gt;Consider this as a shout out to mobile app developers: You are invited! For the first time, there’s a mobile track at this year’s Jenkins User Conference to discuss the best ways to extend CI/CD to mobile application testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As agile practices take hold, enterprises are expecting more collaboration between dev and test teams. Dev teams are doing more testing while QA teams are becoming more skilled at coding. This is happening now, and as a result open-source test automation frameworks like Selenium and Appium are flourishing. At the same time, CI/CD adoption is growing. This is happening more so for web development rather than mobile. It’s no secret that incorporating mobile test automation and CI comes with challenges. Mobile UI testing on real devices is still a manual process for many organizations. Manual testing is perhaps a path of least resistance, but it also commits teams to the longest delivery path.  Some argue they lack the environment, resources or skilled people to create test automation. While the argument rages, its clear other teams are solving the challenge.  Teams are prioritizing the requirement to build a test framework and aligning disparate tools into an effective CI workflow.  Recent webinars with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perfectomobile.com/ni/support/resources/webinars/test-automation-works-for-paychex&quot;&gt;Paychex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perfectomobile.com/ni/support/resources/webinars/journey-devops-replay&quot;&gt;RaboBank&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate CI/CD best practices can effectively extend to mobile app programs using real devices.  Particularly when the lab is moved to the cloud and teams can focus on building robust test automation suites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, the transition to an agile SDLC for mobile apps is happening too slowly. Yet the mobile market demands constant updates. An essential part of an agile SDLC is utilizing automated testing and continuous integration. To test builds using a CI server requires automation which is key to agile development in a fast-paced mobile world because it allows testing to be done by developers early in the lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending CI to mobile programs is easy with Perfecto Mobile’s support for open source frameworks such as Selenium Remote Web Driver, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perfectomobile.com/Company/Media_Room/PRs/perfecto-makes-appium-enterprise-grade&quot;&gt;Appium&lt;/a&gt; and Calabash where existing CI plugins are available. Support for commercial tools like HP UFT is also available.  With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perfectomobile.com/integrations/jenkins&quot;&gt;Perfecto Mobile Jenkins Plugin&lt;/a&gt;, you can perform automated functional testing every build. The result is obvious, discover defects earlier, deliver faster feedback and increase release frequency and, ultimately, have better performing apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about extending your CI practice to mobile projects in our  upcoming JUC mobile session: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1130&quot;&gt;“Fast Feedback: Jenkins and Functional Mobile App Testing Without Pulling Your Hair Out.”&lt;/a&gt; The session will share suggested coding practices along with planning guidance on maximizing the quality coverage during daily, nightly and weekly builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins User Conference US West takes place in Santa Clara, CA on Sep 2-3, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop by the Perfecto Mobile booth and share your story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, our wiki and issue tracker were unavailable from Thursday to Sunday last week. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We host parts of our infrastructure at the Open Source Lab at Oregon State (OSUOSL), including the databases for these two services. So far, there&amp;apos;s no post mortem by OSUOSL (they expect to post one later this week), so we need to piece together what we know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases for the wiki and issue tracker became &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/626903003203637248&quot;&gt;inaccessible around midnight/12 AM Thu/Fri night&lt;/a&gt; (all times UTC). Due to the large number and size of databases on that server, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/626946293663821824&quot;&gt;pulling from backups&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/627027620845129729&quot;&gt;restoring from backup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/627237502420561920&quot;&gt;replaying the binlogs&lt;/a&gt; took them quite a while. During that time, we put up a maintenance screen on the wiki (and messed up the one for Jira, so there were connection timeouts instead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases were back around 3 AM on Sunday. We disabled the maintenance screens around 6 PM later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was a rather lengthy outage, it could have been much worse. We lost none of the data, after all. We thank the OSUOSL team for their efforts getting everything back up over the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a guest post by Manuel Recena Soto (aka recena).

Users of the plug-in know that it has undergone very important changes in the last two years.

Unfortunately, some of these changes resulted in regressions for some users that weren’t properly addressed in subsequent releases. Many users were therefore forced to keep using an older release of the plugin to keep their instances running.

To fix this difficult situation I've decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.

&lt;p&gt;To fix this difficult situation I&amp;apos;ve decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/recena/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/christ66&quot;&gt;Steven Christou&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the community have drawn up a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks we will be focusing our efforts on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going through the Jira tickets
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Checking whether they are duplicated&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Checking whether they are still relevant&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Asking for more information from the people who reported them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Establishing their priority&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reviewing pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investigating bug reports and try to reproduce them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing serious bugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refactoring the plugin to improve its maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning to publish a new 2.5.x bugfix release once a fortnight. We are not considering the inclusion of new features or improvements. The priority now must be to obtain a stable and reliable plug-in, one that will allow us to take things up again in the future with greater security and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in helping? Just send us a message!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Uday made a blog post yesterday that he is looking at organizing a regular Jenkins meet-up in the Silicon Valley Bay Area dubbed "Bay Area Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)."


As a first step, he wants to have a kick-off meeting, to get more insights and opinions about what the topics could be and what people want to hear. I'm really looking forward to it as a means to build a local network, so I signed myself up as a speaker of the first meet-up.


If you are in the Peninsula, South Bay, East Bay, etc., please send some encouragements to him by...

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes-related services by Google are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/&quot;&gt;Google Container Engine&lt;/a&gt;, a Kubernetes-powered platform for hosting and managing Docker containers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/#overview&quot;&gt;Google Container Registry&lt;/a&gt;, a private Docker image registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new Jenkins plugins allow you to make use of Kubernetes and these services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Container+Registry+Auth+Plugin&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Registry Auth Plugin&lt;/a&gt; allows users to authenticate with the Google Cloud Registry so they can push/pull images. This allows you to use the Google Cloud Registry with existing Docker-related plugins, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+build+step+plugin&quot;&gt;Docker build step plugin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin&quot;&gt;CloudBees Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Plugin&lt;/a&gt; implements a cloud provider for Jenkins, and can create slaves based on Docker images on-demand on your Kubernetes cluster or the Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

After several months of inactivity, office hours, the bi-weekly meeting of Jenkins users and developers to learn more about Jenkins, are back.

I'll host the first session next Wednesday at 11 am PDT. This session will be about Stapler, focusing on what Jenkins plugin authors need to know about it, e.g. request routing, form submission handling, or how Jelly/Groovy views work.

While this is going to be a developer-focused session, future session topics will also have Jenkins users as target audience.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have ever used Jenkins you are familiar with what I am about to described, wading your way through job configuration page, looking for the settings that are important, and, depending on your plugin use, wondering where all these other setting came from and what they do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on how long you have used Jenkins, your negative opinion of this experience may vary. If you are a long-time user, you might even view the configuration page with that same reassuring nostalgia seeing a Facebook post from your ugly room mate induces. ‘Yup,he is still ugly and backwards, but we had some good times, back then.’ If you are a newer Jenkins user, it may well send you off to search the web for a viable alternative tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The good news is that CloudBees, in cooperation with the greater Jenkins community, is looking to make some long overdue progress sorting through this user interaction in a way that is both approachable to new users and amenable to existing users who have grown comfortable with a great tool and a ‘stalwart friend’ in a world of otherwise clunky world of IT tools. ( that really is the swiss army knife of build automation.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to have had the opportunity to have attended any of the recent Jenkins User Conferences in Washington, DC, or London, you may have seen Tom and my presentation, which served as our initial introduction of this effort to the Jenkins Community. In this article and the associated video, I will be focusing specifically on the Create and Configuration screens in Jenkins, discussing some of the larger proposed changes, providing some context for the changes and examining their possible repercussions on existing plugins and future plugin development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History of Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For newer Jenkins users, I have found the following visual a helpful guide to understanding the history of Jenkins and how its graphical user interfaces has evolved:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4242/sites/default/files/images/history-jenkins_590.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jenkins timeline: a long history&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing to notice here, is that Jenkins has been around for a long time and in a lot of ways is really fundamental to the art of creating software. Back in 2005, the then Hudson project was using pretty much the same cave chalk as everyone else. 6 years later, the code and community underwent its most substantial transformation to date, as Jenkins emerged as the dominant fork of the Hudson project. If you look closely, you will see the GUI reflected that transformation by….. changing the picture of the butler. In recent times, the interface has taken a few additional steps forward, most notably by moving to a responsive CSS driven layout from its table based origin, but the pace of these changes has been very much akin to the pace of evolution. Slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In our next phase of graphic interface development, however, Tom and I are looking to be a little more directed in our efforts and push the GUI toward a blend of strategic and tactical advancements that will help Jenkins take advantage of some of the advances in web design and browser technologies that have happened over the last 10 years. Our first major push will be in the job creation and configuration tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating and Configuring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a bit of a refresh of the look of these forms, this new effort focuses on the importance of dividing information and presentation into clear categories that ideally are meaningful to both new and veteran users of Jenkins alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Jenkins has these categories already in the GUI, but misses the mark in clarification and emphasis. In other cases, additional categorizing concepts will need to be added. Compare the above screens to the existing screens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you are likely to notice when comparing these two sets of screens is that in the existing screens, there is very little in the way of visual markers segmenting the form input choices on either the item type selection screens (fig 4 vs 2) or the configuration pages (fig 5 vs 3). Adding each new plugin progressively aggravates the situation, and consequently, as your Jenkins installation grows in sophistication and robustness, the average users ability to find the fundamental configuration settings in the sea of ad-hoc options diminishes. While adding functionality typically adds some amount of additional complexity to a UI, by giving each configuration option a visually distinguishable space in the form, the challenge can be greatly diminished and the pattern of creating an ever growing scrolling of toilet paper list of form elements can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For figures 2 and 4, you might also notice that I have chosen Jenkins instances that already have several plugins installed as the basis for my example screens. You might rightly argue that for a basic install, there are not a lot of item types to create, so categorizing them adds a needless layer of complexity. Fair enough. It is my belief, though, that our software can be smart enough to count the item types available for creation and count the number within each category and handle the categorization as necessary. Counting and sorting is something that computers do incredibly well and is not the sort of thing busy people need to be overly burdened with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the code being intelligent about when to present grouping categories to the user, The screen interaction can be similarly intelligent in how it enables the user to selectively show and hide the categories of interest. The following screenshot shows the configuration page focused in on CVS a particular option configuration in the source code management section of the configuration page. It, in turn, has its own sub settings for additional modules and locations (see fig 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and wait for it... ...for comparison, here is today’s CVS settings page...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some serious indentation, the existing page offers significantly less clarity about which settings pertain specifically to CVS instead of other aspects of a Jenkins job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying which settings go with which segment becomes all the more confusing when sub-sections can be re-ordered. To show you what I mean and fit the screen on a single printed page, I am needing to muck with the aspect ratio of today’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left (fig 7) shows a 2 step build process, each with sub parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some fascinating looking red delete buttons in here, I hope I know exactly what part of the build step I am about to blow away.... Did I mention these segments can be re-ordered? Care to guess which form inputs will move with which steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[image]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the above screen shows the same 2 build steps with the same parameters. We still have our friend, Mr. Red Delete button, but now it is a good bit clearer who will get blown away.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, it is considerably clearer which block will be reordered, should I choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about plugins?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a long-time Jenkins user, you may have a guess as to why some of these changes have been slow in coming, and if you are a plugin developer, you definitely know. These input controls have a lot of extension points in them that allow plugins to influence the content of this configuration screen. As a result, how plugins will respond to even the most minor layout changes is somewhat of a mystery. Further, the GUI control elements that make up the form are available to plugin authors to embed as they see fit in their own GUI elements. As a consequence, we have some serious compatibility issues ahead. These challenges are not at all trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, however, I believe with some careful manipulation and diligent testing we can overcome these challenges. The first set of changes are likely to revolve around a file called “hudson-behavior.js”. This file does most of the Jenkins client-side UI magic. If there is data to be bound to a control, this is the file that is likely to handle it. The difficulty with this file stems from two factors, its age (it is written following Yahoo UI framework patterns  which have since been abandoned by Yahoo and the rest of the industry), and a presumption that the page layout will be governed by a single giant HTML table (likely due to the table renaissance happening around the same time, thanks to the emergence of GWT). Regardless of this bit of history trivia, these two issues combine to make changes to the HTML DOM structure of any Jenkins page problematic. Methods such as “findFollowingTR” assume a very rigid parent-child element positioning based on page layout rather than on the logical relationship between the data elements. The good news here is that despite some of their unfortunate names, can be refactored to both find the relevant element based on today’s table structure as well as a future logical nesting of related elements. With that change in place, Jenkins will continue to function as it always has and a future configuration DOM structure can share the same infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The second step here will be finding efficient ways to integrate more modern Javascript libraries, such as JQuery and Bootstrap into the Jenkins GUI.  We will want these libraries to be easier and cleaner for plugin authors to access than PrototypeJS and Yahoo UI are today. Likely this will involve using a Browserify/Requirejs like pattern to control script inclusion in page to avoid naming conflicts, excessively file attachment and global space pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step would then be to begin amending, replacing and augmenting the Jelly based form control set, and thus, transforming the look and behavior of the Jenkins UI. As always, Jenkins is an open community, and we at CloudBees view that as a cherished cornerstone of our own corporate culture. Thus, at every phase of this undertaking we are eager to solicit feedback from and encourage participation by you the members of the community. Feel free to comment directly on this article. Additionally, I am maintaining and active thread on the Jenkins Developer group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ&quot;&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ&lt;/a&gt;). I am looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you write your first custom Jenkins plugin for internal use, it&amp;apos;s easy enough to deploy it on one or maybe two Jenkins instances. You can save it on your local drive and upload the HPI file via the Jenkins Plugin Manager as needed. It&amp;apos;s easy to do this for a few releases. But as your experience grows, the number of plugins and their releases grows as well. The plugins directory on your local drive soon looks like a garbage dump, and it&amp;apos;s difficult to find that most recent version of any plugin. And if you have a lot of Jenkins instances coordinating updates of your plugins may cause a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar situation is when you contribute a much-needed patch to an existing plugin, but you don&amp;apos;t have the time to wait until your pull request is be merged and a new release is cut. Or you may need to patch a plugin in ways not suitable for distribution, and decide to effectively fork the plugin for use on your Jenkins instances. How are you going to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution avoiding the problems from these situations is to set up your own update site to serve your private plugin builds. Juseppe allows you to do this quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-juseppe&quot;&gt;What is Juseppe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juseppe&lt;/em&gt; is an acronym for &lt;em&gt;Jenkins Update Site Embedded for Plugin Publishing Easily&lt;/em&gt;. Juseppe can help you set up a Jenkins update site in just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generates signed &lt;code&gt;update-center.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;release-history.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Works with HPI files directly (stored in one folder), no need to set up a Maven repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watches for changes in the plugin folder and regenerates JSON files when changes are detected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serves generated files and plugin files with built-in Jetty web server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be run in a &amp;quot;generate-only&amp;quot; mode when you want to use a different web server for these files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-i-get-juseppe&quot;&gt;How can I get Juseppe?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ships as a Docker container, or can be built from source. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandex-qatools/juseppe&quot;&gt;the GitHub project page&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. The complete user guide is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandex-qatools/juseppe/wiki/Complete-Guide-of-own-update-center-using-Juseppe&quot;&gt;the GitHub project wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's say you're browsing the 'Available' tab in the Jenkins plugin manager for interesting-looking plugins. How do you learn more about them, preferably without installing them on your production instance? You click the plugin's name, which usually links to the plugin's wiki page, of course!

Unfortunately, it's possible for plugins to be published without a wiki page, or any other documentation aside from what's provided in the plugin itself. This is really unfortunate, as users rely on wiki pages and similar documentation to learn more about a plugin before installing or upgrading it, like its features, limitations, or recent changes.

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;apos;s say you&amp;apos;re browsing the &amp;apos;Available&amp;apos; tab in the Jenkins plugin manager for interesting-looking plugins. How do you learn more about them, preferably without installing them on your production instance? You click the plugin&amp;apos;s name, which usually links to the plugin&amp;apos;s wiki page, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;apos;s possible for plugins to be published without a wiki page, or any other documentation aside from what&amp;apos;s provided in the plugin itself. This is really unfortunate, as users rely on wiki pages and similar documentation to learn more about a plugin before installing or upgrading it, like its features, limitations, or recent changes. Additionally, plugin wiki pages have a special section at the top that provides an automatically generated technical overview of the plugin, such as dependencies to other plugins, the minimum compatible Jenkins version, a list of developers, and links to the source code repository and issue tracker component. Everyone learning about or using a plugin benefits from a plugin wiki page and luckily, almost all plugins have one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; plugin has at least a basic wiki page with some documentation, we decided to only publish plugins in the Jenkins update center that have and link to a wiki page. To keep the impact to a minimum, we&amp;apos;re implementing this plan in several stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage went live on June 1: All existing plugins that don&amp;apos;t have a (valid) wiki link got a wiki link &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/backend-update-center2/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki-overrides.properties&quot;&gt;assigned by the update center&lt;/a&gt; (a so-called &amp;apos;override&amp;apos;), either to an existing wiki page if there was one, or a generic &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+Documentation+Missing&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This plugin has no documentation&amp;quot; wiki page&lt;/a&gt; otherwise. This ensures that no currently existing plugins get dropped from the update center at this point. Of course, &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; plugins that don&amp;apos;t provide a wiki URL and don&amp;apos;t have an override URL will not show up at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage will be enabled later this year: We&amp;apos;re planning to remove all the overrides mentioned above. At this point, plugins may get removed from the update center if they still don&amp;apos;t specify a wiki URL. Of course this isn&amp;apos;t our goal, and we&amp;apos;ll try to work with plugin authors to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? Check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/backend-update-center2/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki-overrides.properties&quot;&gt;current overrides list&lt;/a&gt; to see whether the plugins you care about are affected, and if so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+Documentation+Missing#PluginDocumentationMissing-HowcanIhelp%3F&quot;&gt;see the landing page in the wiki&lt;/a&gt; to learn what you can do. If you have any questions about this process not covered by the wiki, ask us on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev&quot;&gt;Jenkins developers mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been using Jenkins for some time now as the build server for the various projects that are assigned to our four-person software development team, but recently I had exposure to how things were done in a much larger team, and I came away with a better understanding of the kinds of demands that are placed on a build pipeline in these environments.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Jenkins for some time now as the build server for the various projects that are assigned to our four-person software development team, but recently I had exposure to how things were done in a much larger team, and I came away with a better understanding of the kinds of demands that are placed on a build pipeline in these environments. It was quite an education – while the CI pipelines that I administer in our small team might require a handful of virtual machines in our corporate cloud, the pipeline in this team supported over one hundred developers and required several hundred VM instances at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When operating at this scale, efficiency does become important, as the Amazon cloud charges add up and become significant at this level. Using some relatively simple techniques, I was able to gain insight into what actually happened in the more complex build jobs and learned just how these VM instances were utilized. These build jobs configured over a dozen virtual machines each, and understanding the startup and execution flows was critical to making changes and improving efficiencies. I will be discussing how to instrument and analyze these complex builds in my Lightning Talk: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-east/01-02-1615-hobson&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Visualizing VM Provisioning with Jenkins and Google Charts”&lt;/a&gt; and hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We heavily rely on the build nodes concept of Jenkins which I will briefly outline in the session. Besides that I will give some in-depth insights on how we use Jenkins on a daily basis for the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; CI related tasks (e.g. linting code, checking code style, running tests) as well as how Jenkins is used to power our integration tests. Last but not least I will cover how Jenkins acts as a kind of backbone for our Satis server which allows us to host the metadata of our company&amp;apos;s private Composer packages. Throughout the talk I will point out which Jenkins plugins we use in the different contexts to give you a good starting point if you are new in the Jenkins ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;

Scaling and maintenance of thousands of Jenkins jobs

How to avoid creating of a jungle of jobs when dealing with thousands of them?

In our organisation, we have one framework, which is used to develop products. Those products are themselves used to develop end user projects. Maintenance and support are needed at each level of delivery and we use branches for this. This creates hundreds of combinations.

Now, for each product or project version (or branch), we have a delivery pipeline. We start by compiling, testing, packaging, publishing. Then we deploy the application on the different supported platforms and go through different levels...

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling and maintenance of thousands of Jenkins jobs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to avoid creating of a jungle of jobs when dealing with thousands of them?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our organisation, we have one framework, which is used to develop products. Those products are themselves used to develop end user projects. Maintenance and support are needed at each level of delivery and we use branches for this. This creates hundreds of combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for each product or project version (or branch), we have a delivery pipeline. We start by compiling, testing, packaging, publishing. Then we deploy the application on the different supported platforms and go through different levels of validation, until we’re ready for delivery. Aside from a few details and configuration elements, most of the pipelines are identical from one branch to the other, from one project to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one framework, some products, several projects, maintenance branches, complex pipelines… We end up having many many jobs to create, duplicate and maintain. Before even going into this direction, we saw this as a blocking issue - there was no way we could maintain manually thousands of jobs on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution we were looking for should have the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self service - our goal being to delegate the job and branch administration in Jenkins to the projects, in order to reduce the support time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security - we didn’t want to open Jenkins to the projects at configuration level - not acceptable in our context&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity - the solution should be simple enough to be manageable by people not knowledgeable about the core technologies of Jenkins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility - the solution must be flexible enough to allow extensions when needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we thought about using the Job DSL plug-in, delegating the creation of the pipeline to the project teams was OK from a self service point of view, but was not secure and definitely not simple for people not knowing Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we opted for a solution where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;The Jenkins team develops, maintains and versions several &lt;i&gt;pipeline libraries&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project team would edit a simple property file listing the characteristics of the current branch, like which type of platform is supported, which version of the &lt;i&gt;pipeline library&lt;/i&gt; to use, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon commit of this shopping list, the complete branch pipeline is regenerated using the given version of the &lt;i&gt;pipeline library&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;pipeline library&lt;/i&gt; code reads the “shopping list” property file and runs a Job DSL script to generate the branch pipeline according to those parameters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the pipeline library generates a classic pipeline, suitable for most needs. It is also possible to define and use extensions, like having additional jobs in the pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of new features or defects, we develop or branch a new version of the pipeline library and projects or branches can use it by changing the version of their shopping list file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A project gets injected into the system by having only a project seed being generated. From it, the authorised members can generate the branch seed and any branch pipeline at any time. Those seed jobs and the pipelines themselves can also be driven directly from the SCM using our plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project teams are now autonomous and can pilot their pipelines without requesting any support. They act in a secure and isolated way, and cannot compromise the shared environment. The “shopping list” file is simple and well documented. The system is not rigid and allows for extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This platform has been developed initially for a very specific framework and a set of projects which depend on it, but has been extended since to be able to support other stacks. It is structured in two different parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seed platform itself - generation of branch structures in Jenkins and trigger end points for being piloted from the SCM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pipeline libraries, referenced from the shopping list files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still allow some small tools and applications to define directly their pipeline by providing a Job DSL script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same principle, we can also pilot other tools in the ecosystem - like Artifactory or Ontrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ll talk about this seed platform on June 24th, in the Jenkins User Conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Chat Ops and Jenkins

I am very excited to be attending the Jenkins User Conference on the East Coast this year. This will be my third presentation at a JUC and fourth time to attend, but my first on the East Coast. I have learned about a lot of cool stuff in the past, which is why I started presenting, to tell people about the cool stuff we are doing at Drilling Info. One of the cooler things we have implemented in the last year is Chat Ops and our bot Sparky. It started as something neat to play with ("Oooo...

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to be attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east&quot;&gt;Jenkins User Conference on the East Coast&lt;/a&gt; this year. This will be my third presentation at a JUC and fourth time to attend, but my first on the East Coast. I have learned about a lot of cool stuff in the past, which is why I started presenting, to tell people about the cool stuff we are doing at Drilling Info. One of the cooler things we have implemented in the last year is Chat Ops and our bot Sparky. It started as something neat to play with (&amp;quot;Oooo lots of kittens&amp;quot;) but quickly turned into something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever get asked the same questions over and over? What jobs to run to deploy your code? What is the status of the build? These question and more can all be automated so you do not have to keep answering them. Furthermore, when you do get asked you can show them, and everyone else, how to get the information by issuing the proper commands in a chat room for everyone to see. With chat rooms functioning as the 21st century water coolers, putting the information in the middle of the conversation is a powerful teaching technique. You are not sending people to some out dated documentation on how to get their code deployed, nor are you showing them the steps today only to be forgotten tomorrow. Instead you can deploy your code and they see the exact steps needed to get their code deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more impressive is the way ChatOps can bring your company together. Recently our CTO got a hipchat account so he could interact with Sparky. This gave me the idea that if we extend Sparky to deliver information useful to the other teams (Sales, Marketing, Finance, etc) then we would be able to get these wildly disparate teams in the same chat room together and hopefully they will talk and learn from each other. Where DevOps is the bringing together of Dev and Ops, ChatOps can be the bridge across the entire organization. Come see my presentation Day 1: Track 1 at 4:00 PM to learn how ChatOps can enrich your team, how Drilling Info is using it, and what our future plans entail for ChatOps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Automated Testing with Jenkins: At JUC East with Andrew Phillips

Next stop: Washington, DC! I’m looking forward to heading to JUC East in a couple weeks, which runs June 18-19. The Jenkins User Conference is the annual get-together for Jenkins customers, users, partners, developers and community members. It promises to be an exciting two days, and as an added bonus I get to catch up with Kohsuke Kawaguchi and Gene Kim!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop: Washington, DC! I’m looking forward to heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east&quot;&gt;JUC East&lt;/a&gt; in a couple weeks, which runs June 18-19. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/&quot;&gt;The Jenkins User Conference&lt;/a&gt; is the annual get-together for Jenkins customers, users, partners, developers and community members. It promises to be an exciting two days, and as an added bonus I get to catch up with Kohsuke Kawaguchi and Gene Kim!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be giving a talk about a topic that I think is a bit of an elephant in the room in the Continuous Delivery space: the critical importance of optimized Automated Testing. As you start to ship code faster, you’ll need numerous automated tests across many different tools, in many different jobs in your pipeline. But getting a grip on the results of all of your automated tests — and then figuring out whether your software is good enough to go live — becomes harder and harder as you speed up the delivery of your software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll share tips on how naming conventions, partitioning of testware and mirroring the application’s structure in the test code help you best handle automated testing with Jenkins. I’ll also try to provide some insight into how to keep the setup manageable, as well as share practical experiences of managing large portfolios of automated tests. Finally, we’ll showcase some practices that help you manage all your test results and add aggregation, trend analysis and qualification capabilities to your Jenkins setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/&quot;&gt;Join us at the event&lt;/a&gt;, or check the slides or recording (which we’ll post after the talk) to learn more. Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In this talk I will be focusing on plugin development for Jenkins. I aim to capture some of the lessons that we have learned at Delphix and that I learned while I was in graduate school. At Delphix we have been large users of Jenkins for over four years which is most of the history of our startup. We currently run thousands of jobs per day. We have been quite happy with the experience and expect these numbers to grow significantly as our business scales beyond our current 300 head count.

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will be focusing on plugin development for Jenkins. I aim to capture some of the lessons that we have learned at Delphix and that I learned while I was in graduate school. At Delphix we have been large users of Jenkins for over four years which is most of the history of our startup. We currently run thousands of jobs per day. We have been quite happy with the experience and expect these numbers to grow significantly as our business scales beyond our current 300 head count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delphix.com/&quot;&gt;Delphix&lt;/a&gt; is Data as a Service. Our software allows businesses to virtualize databases and data associated with their applications then provision these on demand to developers and others who need virtual copies of them. Our development for this software spans the entire stack. We have quite a few kernel developers, including the original team for the ZFS filesystem who work on developing the open source application, OpenZFS, which underpins our product. Further up the stack we have a large java application that interacts with ZFS to perform virtualization operations, provides user&lt;br /&gt;
facing webservices, and interfaces with our internal Postgres metadata store which stores the state of our system. Finally above this we have a modern Javascript front end for user interaction. Our full software product ships as a virtual machine on a variety of hypervisors. As a result of these numerous components, end to end integration testing is very important to us. This integration testing is the primary use of Jenkins for us. Before any developer checks in code to either our operating system or application repository, it must undergo several hours of automated integration testing. We also have nightly runs which go for far longer and tests a much more extensive set of functionality. In addition, we use Jenkins for the build process of our software as well as final packaging for release. Because Jenkins serves as a hub for our development processes, having a well designed system is very important to us and saves us significant time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the key points I will be discussing at my talk. I hope you attend to learn more about the areas that I find very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;apos;m planning to discuss the structure of a Jenkins plugin. I&amp;apos;ll also cover a few of the more advanced areas of plugins such as distributed builds that I see less frequently in plugins. In addition, I&amp;apos;ll briefly cover unit testing, which is something missing in many open source plugins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;apos;ll talk about some good patterns to use in plugins as well as some areas where a plugin is not a good idea. I&amp;apos;m planning to pull from my own personal experience developing plugins, the experience of other people at Delphix working with Jenkins, and our experience using other open source plugins to talk about what works and what doesn&amp;apos;t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;apos;ll give an overview of the current plugin development at Delphix. I&amp;apos;ll cover some of the lessons that we have learned along the way. We have also started to take a &amp;quot;dogfooding&amp;quot; approach to some of our development where we use plugins internally to help our test process and open source them since our customers find features used for testing our product to often be useful in their production environments. This has an added bonus of making it easier to justify our development time spent on making these plugins, since they are also features requested by our customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;apos;ll discuss the trade-offs between using an already developed plugin or group of plugins, writing some scripts, and building your own plugin. Being able to figure out when to do which can lead to major time savings as well as a better user experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you attend. Even if you have no immediate plans to write your own plugins, hopefully you&amp;apos;ll be able to learn about what makes plugins tick and how to better evaluate plugins when picking them for your own projects. Plugins were what originally got me excited about Jenkins and they allowed me to see its true potential as a build and test system. I hope to share some of that inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

On the 23rd and 24th June, I’ll attend Jenkins User Conference 2015 Europe in London. And I’ll present a lightning talk about Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.

Here is short overview of what I’d like to talk about there.

1. Continuous Build

My starting point was to get to know JenkinsCI. Our developers used JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Build of our software.
So, our developing environment was quite Jenkins friendly from the beginning.

2. Continuous Deploy

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Continuous Build&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we control it? We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://odehne.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/dealing-with-virtual-machines-in-windows-azure-using-powershell/&quot;&gt;Powershell&lt;/a&gt;, which can be executed with JenkinsCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;--- Product Deployment ---&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we achieve the Continuous Deploy? Actually, my boss, who is DirectSmile’s Yoda developed a very powerful tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://odehne.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/continuous-deployment-of-directsmile-products/&quot;&gt;“DirectSmile Installation Service”&lt;/a&gt; to enable this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we integrated this tool within JenkinsCI, and now Jenkins can deploy DirectSmile products on any target server with just one-button-click!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Continuous Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we use JenkinsCI to make the Continuous Testing.&lt;br /&gt;
How do we do that?&lt;br /&gt;
We use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; to make and run tests. So we can cover most features and we can execute it at anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing it after every new version build, to obtain Continuous Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Continuous Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important to share all knowledge and experiences I have had with others, especially those whom have just started with Continuous Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, it is probably much easier than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of this practice, I’d like to share all my knowledge and experiences with how easy it is to achieve Continuous Delivery with Jenkins at JUC 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really exciting to meet and talk about this there! See you at JUC 2015 in London!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Me&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Nobuaki Ogawa, from Japan, and I currently work in Berlin, Germany for the software company &lt;a href=&quot;http://directsmile.com/&quot;&gt;DirectSmile&lt;/a&gt; as a DevOps QA Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very first time I used JenkinsCI, it helped me a lot. Almost all the work I did last year was mainly with Continuous Delivery with Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Build to Deploy, Test, and even Maintenance and Monitoring, my Jenkins takes care of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was super easy to achieve Continuous Delivery in the DirectSmile world with the help of JenkinsCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I’ve implemented numerous test automation projects for clients, but recently I had a unique request. Jenkins plays a critical role.

The “digital channel” is an industry buzzword for many companies these days. The digital channel represents a company’s content that is delivered by websites and mobile devices. Companies want the same website to work across any channel in multiple browsers and different operating systems. They also want that same website to work across an explosion of mobile devices. Add the new generation of smart watches showing up and testing is becoming a huge challenge for IT departments. One big issue is...

Companies want the same website to work across any channel in multiple browsers and different operating systems. They also want that same website to work across an explosion of mobile devices. Add the new generation of smart watches showing up and testing is becoming a huge challenge for IT departments. One big issue is there is too much duplication of testing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, you would create a core set of test automation scripts that work across all digital channels. A client recently requested that my team and I create this perfect-world scenario, and we are doing just that. Jenkins pulls it all together by managing the execution and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me for my talk to learn how I’m using Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, and Perfecto Mobile to solve the digital channel testing challenges for one client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the fall of 2011, the very first Jenkins User Conference was held in San Francisco. Over 250 people showed up. It was, to be completely honest, a bit shocking to me - that little project I’d gotten involved with less than three years earlier was big enough, interesting enough, important enough for 250 people to travel from around the world to spend a day talking about it? That’s an amazing feeling, and it was an amazing day. Since then, there’ve been three more JUCs in the Bay Area, three in Israel and two in Europe, with more talks on...

It was, to be completely honest, a bit shocking to me - that little project I’d gotten involved with less than three years earlier was big enough, interesting enough, important enough for 250 people to travel from around the world to spend a day talking about it? That’s an amazing feeling, and it was an amazing day. Since then, there’ve been three more JUCs in the Bay Area, three in Israel and two in Europe, with more talks on more Jenkins subjects and an ever-increasing number of attendees. This year, there are another four scheduled - three of them for two days each this time! Find out more about the first two, JUC US East and JUC Europe, below!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are there enough worthy talks to merit a full day a few times a year - now there are enough to merit two days! At JUC US East 2015 outside Washington, DC on June 18 and 19, you can see talks on the Workflow plugin for Jenkins, test automation, mobile testing, plugin development, and a few talks on new and fascinating ways people are using Jenkins - even driving big data workflows! And then, just a few days later, on June 23 and 24 in London, there’s JUC Europe 2015, with talks covering things like the fantastic Job DSL plugin, reproducible build environments, Jenkins and Docker together, and my personal favorite, the 2015 edition of my Seven Habits of Highly Effective Jenkins Users talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re interested in the latest innovations in continuous integration and delivery, or you’re a Jenkins plugin developer wanting to learn how to make your plugins more mature and useful, or you’re a Jenkins administrator trying to understand how to provide your users with a great platform for their builds and testing, or even if you’ve just heard about CI/CD and you want to find out more, the Jenkins User Conferences are a great opportunity to see all those things and meet with other Jenkins users and developers. I’m excited to attend my fifth JUC in London, and I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Have you heard Jenkins mentioned, but haven't really done much with it? Are you at JUC because you want to learn more? Has your company been pushing you to use Jenkins or to adapt a more agile build/test process using a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration method?

Jenkins 101 is going to give you an introduction to Jenkins and get you started in the right direction. Many sessions may be too in-depth, too specialized, or do a deep dive too fast, and while that is good for the more intermediate Jenkins user, the beginner can get lost fast and lose interest.

Many sessions may be too in-depth, too specialized, or do a deep dive too fast, and while that is good for the more intermediate Jenkins user, the beginner can get lost fast and lose interest. My session will go through the basics of Jenkins, so anyone without prior knowledge can get up and running in just a short amount of time. We will cover building/configuring jobs, design of pipelines, security of your Jenkins master, fun groovy scripts and useful plugins to get you started. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced Jenkins user, you can always learn from how others are using Jenkins. Attend this session early on in your JUC lineup, so that you get the most out of the conference!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Jenkins is a great tool for automation of all kinds of processes in the software development cycle. Falling back to the year 2008 I remember myself creating my first job and the feeling of enlightenment flowing through my veins :) Then it was just one script running on just one slave (node) and it was enough for that particular task. But years have passed, software systems have become more complicated and terms like «cloud», «distributed environment», «CI/CD» are not a discovery for anyone nowadays.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins is a great tool for automation of all kinds of processes in the software development cycle. Falling back to the year 2008 I remember myself creating my first job and the feeling of enlightenment flowing through my veins :) Then it was just one script running on just one slave (node) and it was enough for that particular task. But years have passed, software systems have become more complicated and terms like «cloud», «distributed environment», «CI/CD» are not a discovery for anyone nowadays. But how can these things be connected and used by Jenkins? The detailed answer for this question will be revealed in my presentation of &amp;quot;compound-cloud&amp;quot; plugin at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/europe&quot;&gt;JUC Europe 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got to Yandex, the QA&amp;apos;s automation concept was the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job takes 1 free slave&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job installs the system under test and tests themselves to this node&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job runs tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job cleans-up and returns the slave back to the pool&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started working for Yandex I understood that the concept of one single slave for a job is not a solution for our tasks because of one particular reason - the system under test was not able to work on a single node… This system is a Yandex MediaAd platform and it requires at least 4 separate nodes to be run on. Better - 8 nodes. Optimal - 40 nodes :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the problem, we thought we would get closer to the solution by simply using a single Jenkins slave as a launchpad for tests and for some tools which will then get some more nodes from the cloud (we already had OpenStack ready) and deploy the system inside them. Thank God we haven’t implemented this solution :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been stopped by the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are lazy and want to write as little code as possible :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a JClouds plugin that can work with OpenStack. Why don’t we use it? &amp;apos;Cause it provisions only 1 slave per job. But it has provisioning algorithms implemented already, and we don’t want to reimplement them…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we create cloud instances with a separate tool, then we have to manage them separately and can’t get profit of using Jenkins’ slave management, which is also implemented already…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if we do so, we also lose Jenkins’ slave features like running a script on the slave, get some reports or statistics and so on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We would also lose visibility: how many slaves we have, how many are busy, how many left til we get to the cloud quota limit? We could go to OpenStack panel then, but it’s totally inconvenient…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this reasoning, the idea emerged! «We should provide an ability to either attach several slaves to a job, or to allow a slave to consist of several nodes». The second way seemed to give more order in slaves management and it was stated to be a final solution for our problem. We called this concept a «compound-slave». And then we coded...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how the compound-cloud plugin was born. It allows us to get such compound-slaves from any cloud plugin installed to Jenkins. Of course there’s also a possibility to form a compound slave from single slaves already attached to Jenkins, but it’s not the true way for hardcore IT guys ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are lots of details on how we use this concept in a real life for our purposes (and I will surely describe the main parts of them in my speech), but here’s a short list of common use-cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We configure a set of labels via the JClouds plugin. Each label represents 1 slave template, like «small_ubuntu_server» or «large_win_server».&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We then configure a compound-slave label via compound-сloud plugin. Each label is a set of single cloud labels. As a result we have a label like «Small test env» consisting of &amp;quot;1x large WinServer + 3x small Ubuntu».&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assign roles to each single node in a compound label, to be able to distinguish them, so the job can run a script on a particular node inside a compound-slave for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assign a label to a job, like it’s done for a JClouds label, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the job starts, a compound-slave provisions from the cloud using the corresponding compound label.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We run a deployment tool on a ROOT role node of a compound-slave. It then deploys the system under test to other nodes inside this compound-slave.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We run tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t bother with creating/cleaning/stopping/deleting slaves. It’s done by Jenkins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get profit :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core feature is that we&amp;apos;ve reused all the provisioning and management mechanisms already implemented in Jenkins and cloud plugins. We just run our jobs and don’t care about the distributed infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
