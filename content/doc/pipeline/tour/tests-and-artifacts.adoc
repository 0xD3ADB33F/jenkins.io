== Reporting test results

If you have a test runner (such as maven surefire, or many of the javascript
runners) the chances are it can output the junit/xml style of test result
reports. If so, recording them is easy:

[source,groovy]
----
post {
  always {
    junit "path/to/xml"
  }
}
----

This will always grab the test results and let Jenkins track them, calculate
trends and report on them. Jenkins has plugins for pretty much all other types
of test runners too. A build that has failing tests is marked as `UNSTABLE` (to
separate it from `FAILED`).

== Storing artifacts

If you want to store an artifact for downloading later (ie keep a record of
it):

[source,groovy]
----
post  {
   success {
      archive "target/**/*"
   }
}
----

A more complete example:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'maven' }
    }
    stages {
        stage("build") {
            sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            archive "target/**/*"
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
