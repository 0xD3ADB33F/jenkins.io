= Creating Pipelines in Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean makes it easy to create new Pipelines or create Pipelines from an existing
`Jenkinsfile`s.  The Pipeline Creation workflow walks you users

== Starting Pipeline Creation

At the top of the <<dashboard, Blue Ocean Dashboard>>,
is a "*New Pipeline*" button that launch the Pipeline Creation workflow.

On new a Jenkins instance, where there are no jobs or Pipelines
and the Dashboard is empty, Blue Ocean will also display a message box offering
to "Create a New Pipeline".

== Creating a Pipeline for a Git Repository

To create a Pipeline from a Git repository,
start by selecting "Git" as the Source Control system.

Then enter the URL for the Git Repository and optionally select which credentials
to use.  If the dropdown down does not show the desired credentials,
they can be added using the "Add" button.

When done, click "Create Pipeline".
Blue ocean will look at all branches for the selected repository,
and will start a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`.

== Creating Pipelines for GitHub Repositories

To create a Pipeline from a GitHub,
start by selecting "GitHub" as the Source Control system.

=== Provide a GitHub Access Token

If this is the first time Pipeline Creation has been run,
Blue Ocean will ask for a
link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/[GitHub Access Token]
to allow Blue Ocean to access your organizations and repositories.

If you have not already created a access token, click on the link provided and
Blue Ocean will navigate to the right page on GitHub,
automatically selecting the appropriate permissions it will need.

=== Select a GitHub Account or Organization

All repositories on Github are grouped by owner, either an account or organization.
When creating Pipelines, Blue Ocean mirrors that structure,
asking users to select an account or organization which owns the repositories
from which it will add Pipelines.

=== Single Repository or All Repositories

Blue Ocean offers two styles of Pipeline creation, either "single Pipeline" or
"discover all Pipelines".

==== New Pipeline from a Single Repository

Selecting "New Pipeline" allows the user select and create a Pipeline for
a single Repository.

After selecting a repository Blue Ocean will scan all the branches in that Repository
and will create a Pipeline for each branch containing a "Jenkinsfile" in the root folder.
Blue Ocean will then run the Pipeline created for each branch in this process.

If no branches in the selected repository have a "Jenkinsfile",
Blue Ocean will offer to "Create a New Pipeline" for that repository,
taking the user to the
<<pipeline-editor, Pipeline Editor>> to create a Pipeline.

==== Auto-discover Pipelines

Selecting "Auto-discover Pipelines" scans all repositories belonging to the selected owner,
and will create a Pipeline for each branch containing a "Jenkinsfile" in the root folder.

This is a more advanced option, that should be used with care.
For large organizations, it can result in the creation of a large number of Pipelines.
Also, if no `Jenkinsfile` entries are found, Blue Ocean does not offer to
create a Pipeline in this case.
