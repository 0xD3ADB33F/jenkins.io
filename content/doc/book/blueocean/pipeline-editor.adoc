= Pipeline Editor

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also great way for existing Jenkins users
to start adopting Pipeline.

The editor allows users to create and edit Declarative Pipelines, add
stages and parallelized tasks that can run at the same time, depending on their
needs. When finished, the editor saves the Pipeline to as ource code repository
as a `Jenkinsfile`.  If the Pipeline needs to be changed again,
Blue Ocean makes it easy to jump back in into the visual editor to modify the
Pipeline at any time.

== Starting the Editor

The editor can be launched via:

* Dashboard "New Pipeline" button
* Activity View for Single Run
* Pipeline Run Details


The
To use the editora user must first have
<<creating-pipelines, created a pipeline in Blue Ocean>>
or have one or more existing Pipelines already in created in Jenkins.
If editing a existing pipeline, the credentials for that pipeline must allow pushing of
changes to the target repository.

== Limitations

The editor has a number of known limitations that users should be aware of:

* SCM-based Declartive Pipelines only
* Credentials must have write permission
* Does not have full parity with Declarative Pipeline
* Pipeline re-ordered and comments removed
