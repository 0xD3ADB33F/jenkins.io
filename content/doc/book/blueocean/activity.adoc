= The Blue Ocean Activity Viewer

The Blue Ocean Activity Viewer shows the all activity related to one
repository Pipeline.

== Activity



== Branches

== Pull Requests

Blue Ocean displays Pull Requests separately from branches,
but otherwise the Pull Requests list behaves similar to the Branches list.

Clicking on a Pipeline will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>>
for the latest completed or in-progress Run of a Pipeline.
"In Progress" runs can be aborted from this list.
Pull Request Pipelines whose latest run has completed can be run again.
Pull Request Pipelines do not display <<dashboard#pipeline-health, "Heath Icons">>
and cannot be edited or marked as favorites.

NOTE: By default, when a Pull Request is closed,
Jenkins will delete the Pipeline and runs for that Pull Request.
That can be changed by changing the configuration of the underlying Multi-branch Pipeline job.
