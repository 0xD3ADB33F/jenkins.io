= Activity View

The Blue Ocean Activity Viewer shows the all activity related to one
repository Pipeline.

== Pull Requests

Blue Ocean displays "Pull Requests" (also called "Merge Requests" depending on the SCM)
separately from branches,
but otherwise the Pull Requests list behaves similar to the Branches list.

Clicking on a Pipeline will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>>
for the latest completed or in-progress Run of a Pipeline.
"In Progress" runs can be aborted from this list by clicking on the "Stop" symbol
(a square "&#9724;" inside a circle).
Pull Request Pipelines whose latest run has completed can be run again by clicking the
"Play" symbol (a triangle "&#9654;" inside a circle).
Pull Request Pipelines do not display <<dashboard#pipeline-health, "Heath Icons">>
and cannot be edited or marked as favorites.

NOTE: By default, when a Pull Request is closed,
Jenkins will remove the Pipeline from Jenkins (to be cleaned up at a later date),
and runs for that Pull Request will not longer be accessible from Jenkins.
That can be changed by changing the configuration of the underlying Multi-branch Pipeline job.
