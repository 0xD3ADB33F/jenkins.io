= Pipeline Run Details

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Run Details view shows the information related to
a single Pipeline Run and allows users to edit or replay that run.
Below is a detailed overview of the parts of the Run Details view.

== Special cases

Blue Ocean is optimized for working with Pipelines in Source Control,
but it can still handle other cases.
Blue Ocean still offers the same Subsection options in all cases,
but those <<#subsections, subsections>> may display different information.

=== Pipelines outside of Souce Control

For Pipelines that are not based on Source Control,
Blue Ocean still shows the "Commit Id", "Branch", and "Change Count",
but those fields are left blank.
In this case, the top menu bar does not include the "Edit" option.

=== Non-Pipeline Jobs

For Non-Pipeline Jobs, such as Freestyle jobs,
Blue Ocean still offers the same Subsection options,
but those subsections may display different information.
The "Rerun" or "Edit" options are also not shown in the top menu bar.

[[subsections]]
== Subsections

// TODO: in progress

=== Pipeline

This is the default subsection and gives an overall view of the flow of this Pipeline Run.
It shows each stage and parallel branch, the steps in those stages,
and the console output from those steps.
