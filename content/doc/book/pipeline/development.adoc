= Pipeline Development Tools

In this section, we'll discuss tools and resources
that help speed development of Jenkins Pipelines.

== Blue Ocean Editor (Declarative only)

The
<<../blueocean/pipeline-editor#, Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor>> provides a WYSIWYG
way to create Declarative Pipelines.


== Command-line Pipeline Linter (Declarative only)

Jenkins can validate, or
"link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)[lint]",
a Declarative Pipleline from the command line before running actually running it.
This can be done using a Jenkins CLI command or using `curl` to post the Jenkinsfile directly.
We recommended using the
<<../managing/cli#ssh, SSH interface>>
for running the linter.

NOTE: See the <<<<../managing/cli, Jenkins CLI documentation>> for details on how to properly configure
Jenkins for secure command-line access.

[source,bash]
----
# ssh (Jenkins CLI)
# JENKINS_SSHD_PORT=[sshd port on master]
# JENKINS_HOSTNAME=[Jenkins master hostname]
ssh -p $JENKINS_SSHD_PORT $JENKINS_HOSTNAME declarative-linter < Jenkinsfile

# curl (REST API)
# Assuming "anonymous read access" has been enabled on your Jenkins instance.
# JENKINS_URL=[root URL of Jenkins master]
# JENKINS_CRUMB is needed if your Jenkins master has CRSF protection enabled as it should
JENKINS_CRUMB=`curl "$JENKINS_URL/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,\":\",//crumb)"`
curl -X POST -H $JENKINS_CRUMB -F "jenkinsfile=<Jenkinsfile" $JENKINS_URL/pipeline-model-converter/validate

=== Examples

.Invalid Jenkinsfile
[source,bash]
----
# pass a Jenkinsfile that does not contain an "agent" section
ssh -p 8675 localhost declarative-linter < ./Jenkinsfile
Errors encountered validating Jenkinsfile:
WorkflowScript: 25: Not a valid section definition: 'agent'. Some extra configuration is required. @ line 25, column 1.
   pipeline &#125;
   ^

WorkflowScript: 25: Missing required section 'agent' @ line 25, column 1.
   pipeline &#125;
   ^

.Valid Jenkinsfile
[source,bash]
----
ssh -p 8675 localhost declarative-linter < ./Jenkinsfile
Jenkinsfile successfully validated.

== Replay Modified Pipeline Runs

Creating Pipelines and debugging failures in Pipelines can be difficult and time consuming.
The standard development process for Pipeline changes -
change, commit, push, run, and analyze - add quite a bit of overhead between iterations.
Sometimes we just want to try out a quick change to a Pipeline and see the result.

The "Replay" feature lets us quickly test modifications to a Pipeline
without creating a new commit or following regular code creation process.
To use the "Replay" feature:

. Select a previously completed run in the build history.
image::pipeline/replay-previous-run.png[Previous Pipeline Run]
. Click "Replay" in the left menu
image::pipeline/replay-left-bar.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
. Make modifications and click "Run".
In this example, we changed "ruby-2.3" to "ruby-2.4".
image::pipeline/replay-modified.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
. Check the results of changes

Replay can be called multiple times on the same run,
allowing for easy parallel testing of different changes.
Replay can also be called on Pipeline runs that are still in-progress.
As long as a Pipeline contained syntactically correct Groovy and able to start,
it can be Replayed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using Replay for larger modifications save your changes
to a file or editor outside of Jenkins before running them.
Syntax errors will cause a Pipeline run to not allow that run to be replayed,
meaning your changes will be lost.
See link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37589[JENKINS-37589]
====

[WARNING]
====
A Pipeline run launched using Replay may behave slightly differently than
a Pipeline run started from an SCM detected commit or Build call.
For Pipelines that are not part of a Multi-branch Pipeline,
the commit information may differ for the original run and the Replayed run.
See link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36453[JENKINS-36453]

== Built-in Documentation and Snippet Generator
Do not overlook the
<<getting-started#built-in-documentation, built-in documentation>> and the
<<getting-started#snippet-generator, Snippet Generator>> when developing Pipelines.
Unlike this handbook, which tracks the current LTS Jenkins
and has limited information about specific plugins,
those resources will be accurate to your currently installed version of
Jenkins and related plugins.

== Pipeline Unit Testing Framework

The link:https://github.com/lesfurets/JenkinsPipelineUnit[Pipeline Unit Testing Framework]
allows you to
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing[unit test]
Pipelines and <<shared-libraries, Global Shared Libraries>>
before running them in full. It provides a mock execution environment where real
Pipeline steps are replaced with mock objects that you can use to check for expected
behavior. New and rough around the edges, but promising.
