The largest Jenkins event, https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World] is coming to San Francisco, California on August 28 - 31, at the Marriott Marquis.  This conference will feature two days of hands-on training, workshops, certification exams and two additonal days, five tracks of technical sessions from Jenkins and DevOps experts from around the world.  You too can be an inspiration for others by joining the pool of experts and become a Jenkins World speaker. https://www.papercall.io/jenkins-world-2017[The Call for Papers is open], last day for submission is March 5, 2017. 

Whatâ€™s new for 2017? Two tracks are dedicated to show and tell. These sessions are technically advanced with some code sharing, heavy on demos and just a tad of slides. If you are like most of us - driven to learn, share, and collaborate...we'd like to hear from you.

Looking forward to your amazing proprosal(s)!
