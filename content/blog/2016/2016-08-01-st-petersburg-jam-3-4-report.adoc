== Meetup #4. "Jenkins Administration" (July 23, 2016)

In Saint Petersburg there is a regular gathering of local IT communities.
This link:TODO[IT Global Meetup] is a full-day event, which provides an opportunity to dozens of communities and hundreds of visitors to meet at a single place.
On July 23rd our local Jenkins community participated in the eight's global meetup.
We conduced 2 talks in main tracks and also had a round table on the evening.

Talks:

* Oleg Nenashev, CloudBees, "About Jenkins 2 and future plans"
 * Oleg provided a top-level overview about changes in Jenkins, 
 shared insights about upgrading to the new Jenkins 2.7.1 LTS and talked about Jenkins plans
 * link:TODO[Presentation] (rus)

   He talked about the flow based on link:TODO[Jenkins Pipeline], link:TODO[JobDSL] and link:TODO[BlueOcean] prototype.

After the talks we had a roundtable about Jenkins (~10 Jenkins experts).
Oleg provided an overview of Docker and Configuration-as-Code features available in Jenkins,

We hope to finally organize a "Jenkins & Docker" meetup at some point.
