Over the last couple years, Pipeline as code has very much become the future of
Jenkins - in fact, at this point, I'd say it's pretty well established as the
*present* of Jenkins. But that doesn't mean it's done, let alone that it's
perfect. While many developers enjoy the power and control that they get from
writing Pipelines using scripting, not everyone feels the same way: a lot of
developers want to specify their build as configuration and get on with building
software.

Pipeline scripts haven't been a good way to do that...until now.

With new changes to Jenkins Pipeline, you are now able to define your Pipeline
from configuration in your `Jenkinsfile` by installing the new Pipeline Model
Definition plugin. It's available today for you to try via the update center.
Be sure to check the documentation for examples on how to get started for a
variety of languages and platforms.

Here's a quick example from link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/master/Jenkinsfile[the plugin's own Jenkinsfile]:

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    tools {
        maven "Maven 3.3.9"
        jdk "Oracle JDK 8u40"
    }

    image label:"any-executor"

    stages {
        stage("build") {
            sh 'echo "path: ${PATH}"'
            sh 'echo "M2_HOME: ${M2_HOME}"'
            sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'
        }
    }

    postBuild {
        always {
            archive "target/**/*"
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
----

It's still early days for this feature, with a lot of further functionality
planned to make it easier and more intuitive to define your Pipelines. All of
that functionality lives on top of Pipeline scripting, so we'll also keep
improving Pipeline steps and syntax outside of the model! And perhaps most
exciting, the Pipeline model will be used by an in-the-works visual editor
that will be part of the Blue Ocean project - while the editor isn't ready yet,
the Pipeline Model Definition plugin will be bundled with the Blue Ocean beta
for you to try out.

This is just a taste of what I'll be covering at my talk on Thursday the 15th
at 3:45pm at Jenkins World, and showing off the same day at the lunchtime demo
theater. I can't wait to see you all there and hear what you think of all this!
