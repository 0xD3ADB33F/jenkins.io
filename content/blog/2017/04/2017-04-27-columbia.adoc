The Jenkins project has learned that a company is trying to register "Jenkins" as a trademark in Colombia. This is alarming for us, and we are trying to oppose it. In order to do this effectively, link:https://goo.gl/forms/Ekt6YhaaAwhrS9GT2[we need to hear from Colombian users of Jenkins].

The Jenkins project owns a trademark "Jenkins" in the U.S., through a non-profit entity link:https://www.spi-inc.org/[SPI Inc]. According to experts on the subject citing the "Washington Convention", our trademark registration in the U.S. does give us some strength in the argument to oppose this. To successfully mount this argument however, we need to be able to show that Jenkins has significant usage and awareness in Colombia. Users, installations, meetups, conference talks, anything of that nature will help.

Those of you with the project for a long time might recall that link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=53608972[the name "Jenkins" was born because of a trademark issue with Oracle]. So we are particularly sensitive to the issue is trademarks. We want to make sure the same tragedy won't happen again.

If you know anything about the usage and the name recognition of Jenkins in Colombia, please let us know by *link:https://goo.gl/forms/Ekt6YhaaAwhrS9GT2[submitting the information here]*. We know that Jenkins is popular in Colombia, because our website traffic shows that Colombian Jenkins users are the third most frequent visitors to jenkins.io in South America after Brazil and Argentina.

This information will be only shared with the Jenkins project board and those involved in the defense, and for the sole purpose of defending the trademark and nothing more.

Please help us spread the word. Thanks!
