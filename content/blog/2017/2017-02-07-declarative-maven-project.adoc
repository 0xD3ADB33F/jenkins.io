== Declare Your Pipelines!

link:/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Jenkins Declarative Pipeline 1.0 is here]!

This is first in a series of blog posts that will show some of cool features of
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition[Declarative Pipeline].
For several of these posts, I'll be revisiting some of my
link:/blog/2016/07/18/pipeline-notifications/[previous posts]
on using with various plugins with (Scripted) Pipeline,
and seeing how those are implemented in Declarative Pipeline.

To start though, let's get familiar with the basic structure of a Declarative Pipeline
by creating a simple pipeline for a Maven-based Java project - the
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit[Jenkins JUnit plugin].
We'll create a minimal Declarative Pipeline,
add the settings needed to run Maven and the JDK,
and finally we'll actually run Maven to build the plugin.

== Setup

With Declarative, it is still possible to run Pipelines edited directly in the
Jenkins web UI, but one of the key features of "Pipeline as Code" is
checking-in and being able to track changes.  For this post, I'm going to use
the
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/junit-plugin/tree/blog/add-declarative-pipeline[`blog/add-declarative-pipeline`]
branch of
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/junit-plugin[my fork] of the JUnit plugin.
I'm going to setup a Multi-branch Pipeline and point it at my repository.

I've also set this pipeline's git client to automatically "clean after checkout"
and to only keep the ten most recent runs.

== Writing a Minimal Pipeline

As has been said before,
Declarative Pipeline provides a more structured, "opinionated" way to create pipelines.

I'm going to start by creating a minimal Declarative Pipeline and adding it to my branch.
Below is a minimal Pipeline (with annotations) that just prints a message:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline { // <1>
    agent any // <2> <3>
    stages { // <4>
        stage('Build') { // <5>
            steps { // <6>
               echo 'This is a minimal pipeline.' // <7>
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node { // <2>
    checkout scm // <3>
    stage ('Build') { // <4>
        echo 'This is a minimal pipeline.' // <6>
    }
}
----
<1> All Declarative Pipelines start with a `pipeline` section.
<2> Select where to run this Pipeline, in this case "any" agent regardless of label.
<3> Declarative automatically does`checkout scm` on the agent,
whereas this must by done explicitly in Scripted Pipeline.
<4> A minimal Declarative Pipeline is defined a series of stages.
<5> Run the "Build" stage.
<6> Each stage in a Declarative Pipeline runs a series of steps.
<7> Run the `echo` step to print a message in the log.

NOTE: If you are familiar with Scripted Pipeline, you can expand the above
Declarative code sample to show the Scripted equivalent.

Once I add above Pipeline to my `Jenkinsfile` and run "Branch Indexing",
my Jenkins will pick it up and run run it.
We see that the Declarative Pipeline has added stage called "Declarative: Checkout SCM":


image::/images/post-images/2017-02-07/junit-minimal.png[Minimal Declarative Pipeline, width=800, role="center"]

This a "dynamic stage", one of several the kinds that Declarative Pipeline
adds as needed for clearer reporting.
In this case, it is a stage in which the Declarative Pipeline automatically does`checkout scm` on the main agent.
As you can see above, we didn't have to tell it do any of this,

.Log Output

[Pipeline] { (Build)
[Pipeline] echo

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS
----

Declarative Pipeline code is a little more verbose than the equivalent Scripted Pipeline,
but the added detail gives a clearer, more consistent view of what the Pipeline is supposed to to do.
It also gives us a structure into which we can add more configuration details about this Pipeline.

== Adding Tools to Pipeline

The next thing we'll add in this Pipeline is a `tools` section to let us use Maven.
The `tools` section is one of several sections we can add under `pipeline`,
which effect the configuration of the rest of the Pipeline.
(We'll look at the others, including `agent`, in later posts.)
Each tool entry will make whatever settings changes,
such as updating `PATH` or other environment variables,
to make the named tool available in the current pipeline.
It will also automatically install the named tool if that tool is configured to do so
under "Managing Jenkins" -> "Global Tool Configuration".


.Jenkinsfile
[pipeline]
----
// Declarative
pipeline {
    agent any
    tools { // <1>
        maven 'Maven 3.3.9' // <2>
        jdk 'jdk8' // <3>
    }
    stages {
        stage ('Initialize') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    echo "PATH = ${PATH}"
                    echo "M2_HOME = ${M2_HOME}"
                ''' // <4>
            }
        }

        stage ('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'This is a minimal pipeline.'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted Not Defined
----
<1> `tools` section for adding tool settings.
<2> Configure this pipeline to use the Maven version matching "Maven 3.3.9"
(configured in "Managing Jenkins" -> "Global Tool Configuration").
<3> Configure this pipeline to use the Maven version matching "jdk8"
(configured in "Managing Jenkins" -> "Global Tool Configuration").
<4> These will show the values of `PATH` and `M2_HOME` environment variables.


When we run this updated Pipeline the same way we ran the first,
we see that the Declarative Pipeline has added another stage called "Declarative: Tool Install":

image::/images/post-images/2017-02-07/junit-tools.png[Declarative Pipeline with Tools Section, width=800, role="center"]

In the log output, we see that during this particular stage "Maven 3.3.9" gets installed,
and the `PATH` and `M2_HOME` environment variables are set:

M2_HOME = /Users/bitwiseman/jenkins/agents/osx_mbp/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/Maven_3.3.9

== Running a Maven Build

Finally, running a Maven build is trivial.
The `tools` section already added Maven and JDK8 to the `PATH`,
all we need to do is call `mvn install`.
It would be nice if I could split the build and the tests into separate stages,
but Maven is famous for not liking when people do that.
I'll leave it alone for now.


.Jenkinsfile
[pipeline]
----
// Declarative
pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
        maven 'Maven 3.3.9'
        jdk 'jdk8'
    }
    stages {
        stage ('Initialize') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    echo "PATH = ${PATH}"
                    echo "M2_HOME = ${M2_HOME}"
                '''
            }
        }

        stage ('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn install' // <1>
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted Not Defined
----
<1> Call `mvn`, the version configured by the `tools` section will be first on the path.

== Conclusion
This new Declarative syntax is a significant step forward for Jenkins Pipeline.
It trades some added some verbosity and constraints for much greater clarity and maintainability.
In the coming weeks, I'll be adding new post every few days demonstrating various
features of the Declarative syntax along with some recent Jenkins Pipeline improvements.
