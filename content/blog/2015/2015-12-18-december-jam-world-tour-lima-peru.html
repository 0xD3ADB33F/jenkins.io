<p>Although December is a short month due to the holidays, there has been a good amount of local Jenkins activities that took place regardless of holiday obligations. Today and tomorrow I will be doing a series of posts to summarize December JAM World Tour. Special thanks to the JAM organizers and co-organizers who made it all happen in these cities:</p><br/>

<p>On December 9 <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Lima JAM</a> hosted their first Jenkins meetup in Lima, Peru. There were attendance from various roles of DevOps: Dev, QA, and Ops. There was also a good mixture of different levels of Jenkins users, some were new and just starting to use Jenkins while others had extensive Jenkins experience.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The group has been invited by Docker and Ansible meetup organizers for a joint event in January to showcase technologies from Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible. Congrats to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Lima JAM</a> group.</p><br/>
