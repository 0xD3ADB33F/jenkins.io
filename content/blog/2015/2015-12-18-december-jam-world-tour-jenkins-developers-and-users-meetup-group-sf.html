<p>Thank you to <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> for sponsoring the yummy burrito bar and offered up their brand new auditorium to host Jenkins Developers and Users Meetup group on Dec 16. We had 96 RSVPs which was impressive. Our speaker for the evening was <strong>Akshay Dayal</strong>, <em>Software Engineer at Google</em>. Akshay's session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided to scale their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their security/availability and failover requirements and how heavy automation played an important role in this effort.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config data externally. Slides are listed below. The video will be posted <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226844066/">HERE</a> once it becomes available.</p><br/>
