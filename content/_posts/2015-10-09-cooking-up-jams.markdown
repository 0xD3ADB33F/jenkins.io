<p>There's been some active discussions and planning around <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup">Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs)</a> specifically in the following cities:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rennes-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Rennes, France</a> 
<li>Seville, Spain 
<li>Seattle, Washington 
<li>Barcelona,Spain
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/">Atlanta, Georgia</a>
</ul></p>

<p>I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at <a href="mailto:jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com</a> if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!</p>

<p>Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you're interested in paying it forward, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup">here's HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer.</a></p>
