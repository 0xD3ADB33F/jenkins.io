<a href='/blog/2015/11/03/what-jvm-versions-are-running-jenkins/'>
What JVM versions are running Jenkins?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Preceding some of last week's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins 2.0</a> discussions, there had been <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk/0gO2V9UXy-8J">some threads</a> on whether we should move Jenkins to require Java 8. The introduction of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/events/us/en/java8/index.html">Java 8</a> last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml">end-of-life announcement</a> for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.</p>

<p>I wanted to answer the question "does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>While we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/">anonymous usage statistics</a>, we do have access logs from our <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org">mirror redirector</a> which might provide some insight.</p>

<p>With some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Jenkins hits the mirror network, it's not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like <code>Java/1.7.0_75</code>. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).</p>

<p>Looking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:</p>

<center><img src="https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/major-jvm-versions.png" /></center>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1.8.0</strong>: 21,278,960</li>
  <li><strong>1.7.0</strong>: 27,340,214</li>
  <li><strong>1.6.0</strong>: 4,148,833</li>
</ul>

<p>This breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them.</p>

<center><img src="https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png" width="600" /></center>

<p>As I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually <em>fairly strong</em>, which I didn't expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we're able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!</p>

<a href='/blog/2015/11/01/adopt-a-plugin/'>
Adopt a plugin!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>With more than a thousand public plugins in the Jenkins community now, it should come as no surprise that some of them are no longer actively maintained. Plugin authors move on when they change jobs, or lose interest in the plugin, and that's fine. Plugins are hosted on the Jenkins project infrastructure after all, and when a maintainer moves on, others can continue their work.</p>

<p>The major problem of course is that it's often difficult to tell whether a plugin is still maintained (and there's just not a lot going on), or whether its maintainer has lost interest. Most plugins don't get released every few weeks, or even every few months, and still do their job just fine.</p>

<p>To connect plugins that aren't actively maintained with potential maintainers, we recently implemented the "Adopt-a-plugin" initiative: We built a list of plugins that are up for "adoption", and display a prominent message on the plugins' wiki pages. Anyone interested in taking over as a plugin maintainer can then contact us, and we'll set you up.</p>

<p>Are you interested in becoming a plugin maintainer? Maybe one of your favorite plugins isn't actively maintained right now. Check out the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin">Adopt a Plugin wiki page</a> for more details on this program, and a list of plugins that would benefit from your help.</p>

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Improved "Out of the box" user experience
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This week we have featured a number of proposals for what we would like to see in "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>", the vision of which is to make Jenkins users more efficient, productive and happy. We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the "inside-out" to today's topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.</p>

<p>Just to recap, so far we've reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core">Splitting Groovy out of 'core'</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center">Pipeline as code front and center</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one">User experience improvements (part one)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The subject of today's proposal is captured in <strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31157">JENKINS-31157</a></strong>, which, like yesterday's <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one">proposal</a>, contains a few issues linked from it with more details.</p>

<p>At a high level, the problem aiming to be solved is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a new user installs Jenkins, they are greeted with the main, empty, dashboard which suggests that they "create jobs." This makes no mention of plugins or the configuration options that are relevant to helping the user make Jenkins match their needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In past and current versions of Jenkins, if you know what you're looking for it's relatively easy to move around the interface. If you've never used Jenkins before, it can be very challenging to find your way around or even know <em>what it is possible</em> to do with Jenkins.</p>

<p>The proposed changes aim to address this initial confusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of changing the post-install defaults, which may not properly represent the user's needs, the first-time user experience should help guide the user through configuration and plugin installation quickly so they can use Jenkins for their needs. Effectively it should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a good configuration for their usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jenkins contributor <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a>, who has led this discussion on the mailing lists in the past, has posted a good prototype screencast of what some of this might entail:</p>

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: UX Improvements (Part One)
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>" is going to include. Today we'll be diving into the most noticeable changes being proposed for Jenkins 2.0: the User Experience (UX) improvements</p>

<p>Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core">Splitting Groovy out of 'core'</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center">Pipeline as code front and center</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The UX improvements being proposed aren't necessarily as uniform as the proposals from earlier in the week but represent a large amount of prototype and exploratory work done by folks like <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gusreiber">Gus Reiber</a> and a few others. Those following the dev list may have already seen some of these proposals in some of the "mega threads" that we have had discussing potential UI/UX improvements previously.</p>

<p>The improvements proposed for 2.0 can be found under <strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31156">JENKINS-31156</a></strong>. The most promising proposal under this issue is to update the <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9802">plugin manager experience</a>.</p>

<p>Another very important proposal for 2.0 worth mentioning is the proposal to <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21092">update UI work well on mobile devices</a>.</p>

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Pipeline as Code front and center
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>" is going to include, today we're discussing my personal favorite, which I believe will have a tremendously positive impact for years to come (not to be too biased!): moving the "Pipeline as Code" support in Jenkins to the front and center.</p>

<p>Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core">Splitting Groovy out of 'core'</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Today's proposal comes from project founder <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> titled "<strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152">Pipeline as code front and center</a></strong>" and represents perhaps the most important and dramatic shift we hope to make in Jenkins 2.0.</p>

<p>This functionality has existed through the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin">workflow plugin</a>, which we have discussed at various Jenkins events before but if you're not aware of some of the power behind it, check out this presentation from <a href="https://github.com/jglick">Jesse Glick</a>:</p>

<center><iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2pZdzaaCXg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>The proposal in <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152">JENKINS-31152</a> expands on the problem we aim to address:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default interaction model with Jenkins has been very web UI driven, requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the details through a web browser. This requires large amounts of effort to create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job configurations themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>lets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of tasks</li>
    <li>stores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable <code>Jenkinsfile</code> in your SCM</li>
    <li>makes it automatic to set up new pipelines when <code>Jenkinsfile</code> is added</li>
    <li>differentiates multiple branches in the same repository</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kohsuke's proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already existing pieces together to provide a <em>very</em> compelling experience for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal is so exciting to me.</p>

<h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>

<p>We're asking you to read the proposal in
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152">JENKINS-31152</a>, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Split Groovy out of "core"
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">yesterday's post</a>, there's been a lot of discussion recently about what "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>" means. In a recent "Office Hours" session, <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> presented his
vision for <strong>Jenkins 2.0</strong> in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eVyc_n8i1c">office
hours</a> session, the slides for
which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ikbbQoMvus_l_q23BxXhYXnW9S5zsVNwIKZ9N8udg4">in this Google
Presentation</a>.
Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke's vision, 2.0 is primarily about making things
better for the thousands of users out there.</p>

<p>This week, we'll be reviewing some <em>key areas</em> of the "Jenkins 2.0" proposal.
Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going
from Jenkins internals to user interface.</p>

<p>Thus far we've covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Today's post involves a proposal originally from community member <a href="https://github.com/jglick">Jesse Glick</a> who has proposed in <strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068">JENKINS-29068</a></strong> that <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">Groovy</a> be split out from the "core" Jenkins distribution. The linked issue expands on what the problem is here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into "core" for a variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were upgraded to a different major version, it may break users' custom scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split Jenkins' use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the library, etc.</p>

  <p>Stuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin depending on it (if first-class features themselves):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin developers, power and casual users alike. I encourage everybody to read through the proposal and its potential impact <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068">on the issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>

<p>We're asking you to read the proposal in
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068">JENKINS-29068</a> and provide

<p>If you have ever logged in to the <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Introduce a policy for API deprecation
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Over the past few weeks there has been a vibrant discussion happening on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev/topics">jenkinsci-dev@</a> mailing
list as to what "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>" means.  While
Jenkins does not currently adhere to <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>,
the change of a major version number does indicate a major milestone for the community.</p>

<p>Project founder, <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> presented his
vision for <strong>Jenkins 2.0</strong> in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eVyc_n8i1c">office

Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these proposals, going

<p>Today's post involves a proposal to introduce a policy for <strong>API
deprecation</strong> from community members <a href="https://github.com/olivergondza">Oliver
Gondža</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">Daniel
Beck</a>. Extensibility is the heart of Jenkins, but over the past ten
years we've not had a proper API deprecation policy other than "try not to
break plugins, ever."</p>

<p>Daniel, expanding more on the problem wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have no backward compatibility policy besides "compatibility matters".
With 1000+ plugins and basically the entire core being available to
plugins, a lot of difficult or impossible to remove cruft has accumulated over
the last ten years. This limits both what can be changed in core, and makes
documentation difficult to use for plugin developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two have put together a detailed proposal under
<strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035">JENKINS-31035</a></strong> which
suggests we:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>limit the availability in APIs (classes, methods, fields, …) provided by core
to a number of releases. Depending on the feature, this can range from a few
months, to a few years (e.g. two years being about 100 releases of Jenkins and
eight LTS baselines).</p>

  <p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly encourage you to read the entire proposal <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035">on the issue
tracker</a>, where we are
trying to collect feedback/history.</p>
