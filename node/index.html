Celebrating Hacksgiving!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.</p>

<center><img src="https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hacksgiving-platter.png" border="0" /></center>

<p>Taking a cue from the <a href="/content/adopt-plugin-0">Adopt a Plugin</a> program that <a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">Daniel</a> wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a "virtual hackathon" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus <strong><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015">Hacksgiving 2015</a></strong> was created!</p>

<p>We'll be hosting Hacksgiving <strong>Nov 23rd</strong> and <strong>Nov 24</strong> from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/">RSVP here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>You don't need to know Java to help!</strong> We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.</p>

<p>We have a few goals for Hacksgiving:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Documentationhacking">documentation hacking details here</a>).</li>
  <li>Find some plugins which <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin#AdoptaPlugin-Whichpluginsarecurrentlyupforadoption%3F">are up for adoption</a> new maintainers.</li>
  <li>Clean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Pluginstocleanup">listed here</a>).
<!--break-->
### Sessions to note</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some of the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Schedule">sessions scheduled</a> that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>7:00PST/10:00EST (<em>15-30min</em>) - <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">rtyler</a> will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing">contributors guide</a>)</li>
  <li>10:00PST/13:00EST (<em>60min</em>) - <a href="https://github.com/christ66">schristou</a> will host a workshop titled "Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>10:00PST/13:00EST (<em>60min</em>) - <a href="https://github.com/abayer">abayer</a> will be hosting a "Plugin Developer Open Q&amp;A" session, so bring your questions!</li>

<p><strong>Updated 2015-11-11 15:00 UTC:</strong> We have released Jenkins 1.638 and 1.625.2 which contain a fix for this vulnerability. <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2015-11-11">See the security advisory for more information about these releases</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Updated 2015-11-06 03:55 UTC:</strong> Included a updated mitigation script which doesn't have a Jenkins boot race condition</p>

<hr />

<p>Earlier today we received numerous reports about a previously undisclosed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_%28computing%29">zero day</a>" critical remote code execution vulnerability and exploit in Jenkins core. Unfortunately the vulnerability was not disclosed to us ahead of its publication so we're still working on more thorough fix. In the <em>meantime</em> however, we wanted to inform you of the issue and provide a workaround which will help prevent this exploit from being used against public Jenkins installations, for future reference this issue is being tracked privately as <code>SECURITY-218</code> in our <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The attack is mounted through the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI">Jenkins CLI</a> subsystem, so the work-around is to remove/disable the CLI support inside of the running Jenkins server.</p>

<p>Using the following Groovy script you can disable the attack vector in your Jenkins installations by navigating to “Manage Jenkins” and then to “Script Console”, or just go to <code>http://your-jenkins-installation/script</code>. This only addresses the current running Jenkins process, in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to <code>$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy</code> (create the directory if necessary, and the file).</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>import jenkins.*;
import jenkins.model.*;
import hudson.model.*;

// disabled CLI access over TCP listener (separate port)
def p = AgentProtocol.all()
p.each { x -&gt;
  if (x.name.contains("CLI")) p.remove(x)
}

// disable CLI access over /cli URL
def removal = { lst -&gt;
  lst.each { x -&gt; if (x.getClass().name.contains("CLIAction")) lst.remove(x) }
}
def j = Jenkins.instance;
removal(j.getExtensionList(RootAction.class))
removal(j.actions)
</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>in order to make the workaround persist between restarts of the Jenkins server, add the script below to <code>$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy</code> (create the directory if necessary, and the file).</p>

<p>The latest version of this script can be found <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218">in this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>As previously announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories">jenkinsci-advisories</a> mailing list we’re preparing a security release for this upcoming Wednesday which will include patches for both the latest and LTS lines of Jenkins core. The Jenkins Security team is working to include a fix for this previously undisclosed exploit in or before this planned security release.</p>

<p>If you have questions about this exploit, join us in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23jenkins&amp;uio=d4">#jenkins channel on Freenode</a> or ask on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-users">jenkinsci-users@ mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>For security researchers and hobbyists, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Jenkins, we have some disclosure guidelines <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories">on this wiki page</a> which will help us mitigate any discovered issues as quickly and safely as possible.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be sure to subscribe to the jenkinsci-advisories mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories">jenkinsci-advisories</a>), it's the fastest way to get updates by the Jenkins Security team.</p>

<a href='/blog/2015/11/03/what-jvm-versions-are-running-jenkins/'>
What JVM versions are running Jenkins?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Preceding some of last week's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins 2.0</a> discussions, there had been <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk/0gO2V9UXy-8J">some threads</a> on whether we should move Jenkins to require Java 8. The introduction of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/events/us/en/java8/index.html">Java 8</a> last year brought performance improvements and highly desirable API changes, which make developing Java-based applications (arguably) much easier than before. The release was followed earlier this year by the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml">end-of-life announcement</a> for Java 7; the writing is on the wall: upgrade to Java 8.</p>

<p>I wanted to answer the question "does it even make sense to force an upgrade to Java 8?" There are plenty of technical discussions that we can have in the community on whether or not this is the right approach, but my goal was to try and measure the current Jenkins install base for Java 8 preparedness.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>While we do not currently (to my knowledge) collect Java runtime versions in our <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/">anonymous usage statistics</a>, we do have access logs from our <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org">mirror redirector</a> which might provide some insight.</p>

<p>With some access logs data, I went through the millions of requests made to Jenkins infrastructure in 2015 and started filtering out the user agent which made those requests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This data is totally not scientific and is only meant to provide a coarse insight into what versions of Java access Jenkins web infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Jenkins hits the mirror network, it's not overriding the default user agent from the Java runtime, so many of the user agents for the HTTP request are something like <code>Java/1.7.0_75</code>. This indicates that the request came from a Java Runtime version 1.7.0 (update 75).</p>

<p>Looking at the major JVM versions making (non-unique) requests to Jenkins infrastructure we have:</p>

<center><img src="https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/major-jvm-versions.png" /></center>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1.8.0</strong>: 21,278,960</li>
  <li><strong>1.7.0</strong>: 27,340,214</li>
  <li><strong>1.6.0</strong>: 4,148,833</li>
</ul>

<p>This breaks down across various updates as well, which is also particularly interesting to me because many of these Java versions have long since had security advisories posted against them.</p>

<center><img src="https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jvm-versions-with-updates.png" width="600" /></center>

<p>As I mentioned before, this is not a rigorous analysis of the access log data and is also not filtered by unique IP addresses. What I found most interesting though is that the Java 8 upgrade numbers are actually <em>fairly strong</em>, which I didn't expect. I expect that piece of the pie will continue to grow. Hopefully so much so that we're able to move over to Java 8 before the end of 2016!</p>

<a href='/blog/2015/11/01/adopt-a-plugin/'>
Adopt a plugin!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>With more than a thousand public plugins in the Jenkins community now, it should come as no surprise that some of them are no longer actively maintained. Plugin authors move on when they change jobs, or lose interest in the plugin, and that's fine. Plugins are hosted on the Jenkins project infrastructure after all, and when a maintainer moves on, others can continue their work.</p>

<p>The major problem of course is that it's often difficult to tell whether a plugin is still maintained (and there's just not a lot going on), or whether its maintainer has lost interest. Most plugins don't get released every few weeks, or even every few months, and still do their job just fine.</p>

<p>To connect plugins that aren't actively maintained with potential maintainers, we recently implemented the "Adopt-a-plugin" initiative: We built a list of plugins that are up for "adoption", and display a prominent message on the plugins' wiki pages. Anyone interested in taking over as a plugin maintainer can then contact us, and we'll set you up.</p>

<p>Are you interested in becoming a plugin maintainer? Maybe one of your favorite plugins isn't actively maintained right now. Check out the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin">Adopt a Plugin wiki page</a> for more details on this program, and a list of plugins that would benefit from your help.</p>

Jenkins 2.0 Proposal: Improved "Out of the box" user experience
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This week we have featured a number of proposals for what we would like to see in "<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins
2.0</a>", the vision of which is to make Jenkins users more efficient, productive and happy. We started with some more internally facing changes and have slowly progressed from the "inside-out" to today's topic: improving the out of the box user experience. That is to say, the experience that a brand-new Jenkins user has when getting started with the server.</p>

<p>Just to recap, so far we've reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation">Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core">Splitting Groovy out of 'core'</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center">Pipeline as code front and center</a></li>
  <li><a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one">User experience improvements (part one)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The subject of today's proposal is captured in <strong><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31157">JENKINS-31157</a></strong>, which, like yesterday's <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-ux-improvements-part-one">proposal</a>, contains a few issues linked from it with more details.</p>

<p>At a high level, the problem aiming to be solved is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a new user installs Jenkins, they are greeted with the main, empty, dashboard which suggests that they "create jobs." This makes no mention of plugins or the configuration options that are relevant to helping the user make Jenkins match their needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In past and current versions of Jenkins, if you know what you're looking for it's relatively easy to move around the interface. If you've never used Jenkins before, it can be very challenging to find your way around or even know <em>what it is possible</em> to do with Jenkins.</p>

<p>The proposed changes aim to address this initial confusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of changing the post-install defaults, which may not properly represent the user's needs, the first-time user experience should help guide the user through configuration and plugin installation quickly so they can use Jenkins for their needs. Effectively it should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a good configuration for their usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jenkins contributor <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a>, who has led this discussion on the mailing lists in the past, has posted a good prototype screencast of what some of this might entail:</p>

<p>If you have ever logged in to the <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue
tracker</a> or the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">wiki</a>, you have a "Jenkins user account" which

<p>We're going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.</p>

<p>This concludes this week's blog series highlighting some of the Jenkins 2.0 proposals we felt were important to discuss with the broader Jenkins user audience. Many of these, and other minor proposals, can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0">Jenkins 2.0 wiki page</a>.</p>
