SCaLE 14x Conference Report

<div class='content'>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historically January has always been a very big month for the Jenkins
community. Between <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>
<a href="https://socallinuxexpo.org">Southern California Linux Expo</a>  (also known as
SCaLE) we seem to hand out more stickers during the last week in January than
any other week of the year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This year&#8217;s SCaLE 14X conference finally outgrew the LAX Hilton in Los Angeles,
where it had been hosted in years past, and moved over to the Pasadena
Convention Center in Pasadena California. While the organizers of the
conference expanded their scope, so did the Jenkins project!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to our normal Jenkins stickers, we also had some special edition
stickers with <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Logo">special
logos</a> to give away this year, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Angry Jenkins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Jenkins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superhero Jenkins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Cute" Jenkins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ninja Jenkins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To accompany the stickers we also had both blue Jenkins and red "Angry Jenkins"
pins. Savvy Jenkins users might recognize "Angry Jenkins" from the Jenkins
server&#8217;s internal 500 page; fortunately however very few people that came by
the booth to say <em>hello</em> were familiar with Angry Jenkins.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="talking-points"><a class="anchor" href="#talking-points"></a>Talking Points</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from talking about the cool stickers and pins, we spent the vast
majority of time talking about Jenkins to two groups of people:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>those who never had actually used Jenkins, even if they had heard of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>users who knew plenty about Jenkins but hadn&#8217;t actually heard about some of
the <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposals">Jenkins 2.0 Proposals</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anecdotally, it seemed like most of the people that I talked to about "Jenkins
2.0" were pretty excited about the <code>Jenkinsfile</code> idea and starting to define
their <a href="/solutions/pipeline">build processes and delivery pipelines as code</a>
in their source repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps more importantly though, we spoke with many users about where Jenkins
is causing them pain or frustration. Speaking directly with users at events
like SCaLE or Jenkins Area Meetups is always fun, having a high-bandwidth
conversation about what we can do better and/or offering solutions/workarounds
to hopefully relieve some pain-points.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one such case, a contributor approached me and complained that he had
emailed the developers' mailing list and frustratingly never actually received
a response. Comically enough, neither of us were able to find the email he had
sent the mailing list (whoops!) but because of the dynamic nature of booth-duty
at SCaLE, we got him squared away with a repository to contribute a
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-charm">Jenkins Charm</a> for the Juju
configuration management tool.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="jammin"><a class="anchor" href="#jammin"></a>Jammin'</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the booth-duty highlights was meeting a few folks who were interested on
starting a southern California Jenkins meetup. Over the days following the
conference, and a brief discussion on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/jenkinsci-jam/a071f664-30ab-44eb-b65f-a6f19cfbfdf5%40googlegroups.com.">jenkinsci-jam@
mailing list</a>, and the
<strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Los Angeles
Jenkins Area Meetup</a></strong> was born!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the meetup growing over the next couple months and
helping build a stronger local Jenkins community in Southern Califonia for the
other 51 weeks a year that SCaLE isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://socallinuxexpo.org">SCaLE</a> is one of my more favorite
open source conferences, the positive community in attendance, a kid-friendly
atmosphere ("Game Night" was a blast) and the broad spectrum of sessions
available make it a great way to spent the weekend in southern California.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We hope to see you there again next year!</p>

<p>Planning is underway for <strong>Jenkins World</strong>, a major Jenkins event for developers,
release engineers and others interested in automation. The conference will be
held from <strong>September 13th to 15th</strong> in Santa Clara, California and is being
organized and sponsored in part by <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a>.
Just like the "Jenkins User Conferences" before it, this year&#8217;s event will
feature many experts from the Jenkins community that help make Jenkins
the most popular open source automation server on the planet. We&#8217;ve found that
we outgrew the popular multi-city one-day Jenkins User Conferences, so unlike
previous years Jenkins World will be a three-day event in one place with an
incredible amount of great content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of the event is to bring Jenkins contributors and users of all levels
together, from around the world, to discuss, share and learn from one another.
Starting <em>today</em> we&#8217;re opening the
<strong><a href="https://jenkins-cfp.herokuapp.com/events/jenkins-world-2016">call for
proposals</a></strong>. As a global event, users from all over the world are encouraged to
submit a talk between now and <strong>May 1st, 2016 (11:59pm PST)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We look forward to receiving your amazing submission, and seeing you in Santa
Clara this fall.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe strongly that we can make meaningful user experience improvements to Jenkins, but it will require having more weapons in our arsenal in terms of how we build plugins etc. This is what we&#8217;ll be talking about in this week&#8217;s office hour. It will be a developer-focused session where we&#8217;ll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools. We&#8217;ll also dissect and run some sample plugins that show these newer client-side dev tools in action.</p>

Software Architect at <a href="http://www.aoe.com">AOE</a>, who is outlining some of the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them are really
beautiful and flexible enough from my point of view. For example, I could not
find a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data
should be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the
possibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do
with Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins
data. But I cannot do that with the existing built-in dashboards from Jenkins
plugins which are Jenkins-content specific.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid
re-inventing the wheel I also decided to use
<a href="https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js">dashing-js</a> as a basis and not
Jenkins itself. dashing-js is a Node.js port of
<a href="http://dashing.io/">Dashing</a>, a <a href="http://sinatrarb.org">Sinatra</a>-based
framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key features of Dashing are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, HTML and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Widgets harness the power of data bindings (via <a href="http://batmanjs.org/">batman.js</a>) to keep things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> and simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple Node.js script for fetching data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag &amp; drop interface for re-arranging your widgets</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage over a native Java-based Jenkins plugin is that you don&#8217;t need to
know Java and the whole Java stack. You can also easily add other pre-made
third-party widgets, for example a GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS
statistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent
of Jenkins. All you need is Node.js and the permission to access the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API">Jenkins API</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beside dashing-js you will need my
<a href="https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/">Jenkins Job widget</a>. It is a
generic widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the
build status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it
is possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see
in the screenshot below).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, all you need is dashing-js, my Jenkins Job widget and some
<a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> packages.  The installation and the setup is really
easy and can be found <a href="https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the past couple months, we have been working on a long overdue
<a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for the Jenkins project (meeting minutes
<a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/2015/jenkins-meeting.2015-12-09-19.01.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/2016/jenkins-meeting.2016-01-06-19.01.html">here</a>).
Following in the footsteps of other projects like the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Apache Software
Foundation</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/conduct">Go lang</a> and
<a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">countless others</a>, we have adopted this
code of conduct to help set guidelines for what behaviors are acceptable, and
what behaviors are not, when acting within the Jenkins community or on behalf
of the Jenkins project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to extend our gratitude to the authors of
<a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">the Contributor Covenant</a> who provided us
with a very good and mostly finished Code of Conduct template. We have
<a href="/conduct">adapted the covenant</a> to meet the unique needs of a multifaceted
project like Jenkins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The document itself is broken down into three sections, all of which I
encourage you to read:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/conduct#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a> itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/conduct#reporting">Instructions on how to report problems</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/conduct#handling-of-violations">An outline of how violations will be handled</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to many other process and philisophical documents in the Jenkins
project, the document is not etched in stone and is therefore intended to be
updated. If you&#8217;re interested in participating in the discussion about this,
and other topics around how the Jenkins project operates, I invite you to the
<code>#jenkins-community</code> IRC channel on the <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode
network</a> or to our regularly scheduled

A new Jenkins website

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">I</a> first started working on the Jenkins
website, then called by a different name, I selected
<a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, an extensible content management system, to
get the job done. Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install
plugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal
has served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general requirements for something newer were:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Easy to edit and create content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to content should be tracked and reviewable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any Jenkins contributor should be able to participate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support mixed content types</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on
GitHub, would meet the majority of the "ease-of-use" type requirements. The
remainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years
ago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, commonly used by
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, but the effort stalled as I ran
into challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,
events, pages, people, etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having recently discovered <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>, a more
versatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org">asciidoctor.org</a>, I ventured down that path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger
and switched <code>jenkins-ci.org</code> over to the new site. In fact, the page you&#8217;re
reading <strong>right now</strong> was authored and published via our new
<a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io">jenkins static site</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page
there is a link titled "Improve this page" which will take you directly to
GitHub to edit this post!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&amp;projectKey=WEBSITE">tracked
in JIRA</a>, but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,
correct and create new blog posts and pages for <code>jenkins-ci.org</code>!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the past few years, a couple members of the Jenkins project have made the
trip to Los Angeles for the
<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x">Southern California Linux Expo</a>.
Despite the name it&#8217;s a fairly broad open source technology conference and
since it is hosted prior to <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, it&#8217;s also a good
conference to get us in the open source mood after the holiday break.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike previous years, when SCaLE was hosted at the LAX Hilton, this year it has
grown and moved to the
<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/venue">Pasadena Convention
Center</a>. There, as with previous years, we&#8217;ll have a table in the expo hall with <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/status/662718638135181313">plenty of
stickers</a> and <em>perhaps</em> some other forms of swag available for devotees to
collect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expo hall will be open January 23rd and January 24th, and a few Jenkins
contributors will be there to ask questions to, talk about CI/CD and hand out
stickers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">I</a> have a presentation on
Saturday, January 23rd titled
"<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/continuous-delivery-infrastructure-jenkins">Continuous
Delivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins</a>"</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="title">Talk abstract</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into
practice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage
and deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error
rate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means
less time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the talk I&#8217;ll be highlighting some of the positive, and negative,
patterns used by the <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra">Jenkins
infrastructure</a> team to manage, test and deliver the Jenkins project&#8217;s own
infrastructure. Sort of a followup from my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqLGKa4QwA">2014 PuppetConf talk</a> about
migrating Jenkins infrastructure from masterless
<a href="https://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> to a
<a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/index.html">Puppet Enterprise</a> oriented
installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re in the LA area, we hope to see you for <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14">SCaLE 14X</a> in Pasadena!</p>

<p>On December 15, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Toulouse-Java-User-Group/events/226522097/?eventId=226522097">Toulouse
JAM</a>
was co-hosted with the <a href="http://www.toulousejug.org/2015/11/06/jenkins.html">Toulouse
JUG</a> and <a href="http://toulousedevops.org/">Toulouse
DevOps</a>. Indeed it made sense since Jenkins is
written in Java, makes use of Groovy code in many places (system groovy script,
job dsl, workflow…), and it also made sense to co-organize with the local
DevOps community since Jenkins is also a great tool to enable Continuous
Integration, Continuous Delivery and automation in general. There were 103
RSVPs, with 80 to 90 people in attendance.</p>

<p>There were 3 talks planned for the evening:</p>
