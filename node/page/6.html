<br/>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/event/juc/2014/san-francisco">JUC West 2014</a> was packed with good gems of information – such as "how we did it" talks where the speakers shared their points of view on the tools they use for automating their pipeline. At JUC and other conferences I especially seek out talks about how others implement their Continuous Delivery processes.   At the upcoming <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west">JUC West 2015</a>, it is my turn to share “how we did it” at Perforce. I will present my talk "Continuous Delivery: Driving Lessons” and describe our journey, the rewards we reaped, and the challenges we faced along the way.</p><br/>
 <br/>
<p>At <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a>, we see Continuous Delivery as taking the proven technique of automation and expanding it to a solid set of practices that make the pipeline even more efficient. This includes empowering the product teams to own production and quality all the way from requirements to delivery, and moving from a central build and release team to a self-serve infrastructure to remove the "friction" in the workflow. These changes have allowed us to quickly, efficiently and reliably adapt our software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market, and changes to the business strategy. </p><br/>
<br/>
<p>I look forward to seeing you there!</p><br/>

<p>A few years ago, the Jenkins community announced the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/announcing-jenkins-cia">Jenkins CIA program</a> - the Continuous Integration Ambassador initiative to spread the word of Jenkins. As of recently, there hasn't been as much activity, so this program needs to be revived!</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>There are over 120,000 active Jenkins installations now and that number just keeps climbing and climbing. It's important to bring all of us together through big events like the Jenkins User Conference, but not everyone can get there. That is why Meetups and smaller Jenkins events are crucial.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>To support this effort, CloudBees has announced that they will be sponsoring the kickoff of the CIA revival/<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/bay-area-jenkins-area-meet-looking-you">JAM</a> to help the Jenkins community host these Meetups!</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>To kick this off, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225059665/">the first Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)</a> is in the San Jose CloudBees office on <strong>Sept 23</strong>. We are shooting to have a JAM everything 3rd Wednesday of every month to consistently bring the community together.</p>

<p><h3>Cloud Native and the benefits to Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>There’s a lot of discussion lately around Cloud Native. If this term is new to you, I suggest a quick read of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/cloud-native-what-it-means-why-it-matters/d/d-id/1321539">Cloud Native: What it Means and Why it Matters?</a> From my perspective, Cloud Native offers tremendous benefit to enterprise companies, startups and developers looking to add value quickly or capture market share. Cloud Native platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, provide a number of features to reduce the effort of developing software and operating it on or off premise. A few notable features include load balancing, application routing, cluster scheduling, and containerisation. Cloud Native also offers a significant advancement for building integrated pipelines to deliver software. Before we discuss these advancements, let’s consider the role of the container.</p><br/>
 <br/>
<p><h4>Containers</h4></p><br/>
<p>One of the most influential components of Cloud Native is the container. At this point, containers are fairly ubiquitous and most developers have experimented or used containers. For instance, if you've pushed an application to Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services, you’ve used an container without knowing it.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Initially containers were a place to automate the deployment and execution of your code, but over time customization became necessary to handle specific use cases. As a result, container creation now occurs earlier in the development and build phase. As applications are packaged within binaries and containers, validation of the application and container configuration needs to be validated before leaving the developer’s laptop. So what does this mean for the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline?</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><h4>CD Pipelines</h4></p><br/>
<p>Developers will tell you their role has expanded over the years as agile methodologies have changed the way software is engineered. Techniques like Test Driven Development (TDD) and CD pipelines encourage software teams to deliver higher quality code in every build. Of course, a good CD pipeline starts at the developer’s laptop. Building and testing the start of a pipeline requires the correct tools while preserving the developer’s choice of container.</p><br/>
 <br/>
<p>The diagram below demonstrates a simple CD pipeline. As you can see, the pipeline starts from the developer’s IDE and uses Cloud Foundry’s  <a href="http://lattice.cf/">Lattice</a>to provide a sandbox to validate the delivery artifacts. Lattice, based on Cloud Foundry’s container scheduler, delivers a small Cloud Native Platform that can be scaled up in the cloud or scaled down to a laptop. It includes a cluster scheduler, HTTP load balancing, log aggregation and health management for containers. Best part, it offers developer choice. Lattice provides support for both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry buildpacks.</p><br/>
<br/>
<div style="float:left; margin:1em"><br/>
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/omeara-pic_0.png" width=600 height=366><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p>Lattice’s flexibility makes it extremely easy to test how the application, which runs in a Docker container, will function in a Cloud Native environment. It’s also extremely helpful for developers engaged in a spike (prototype phase) where they want to push, validate and demonstrate code and let the platform handle the container creation, runtime environment and deployment artifacts via Cloud Foundry buildpacks.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Extending the CD pipeline beyond the developer’s laptop to deliver value to the organization will require additional tools like the <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-platform">CloudBees Jenkins Platform</a>, <a href="http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/">Artifactory</a> and <a href="http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. These enterprise build-and-deploy solutions help developers deliver to a Cloud Native platform and reduce the time to establish the feedback loop. If the enterprise maintains a Hybrid cloud strategy, these tools make it seamless to deploy across different cloud providers.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>As developers build more Cloud Native applications for Cloud Native platforms, it’s important to establish good tool chains and best practices early in the development phase. Interested to see these tools in action? Join us at Jenkins User Conference West on September 2nd to learn how I use these tools to build <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-01-1400">Integrated Deployment Pipelines with Jenkins and Cloud Foundry</a>.</p><br/>

<p>We're currently setting up a program to support community members' travel to Jenkins community events. Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.</p>

<p>We're still hashing out the details, but it'll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you'd like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program">current draft of the travel grant program</a>.</p>

<p>The first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/01-01-1400-bhattacharya">a speaker at this year's JUC Europe</a> in London, and will give <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1400">two</a> <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1130">talks</a> at <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west">JUC US West</a> next week—and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea—so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.</p>

<p>Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!</p>

<p><h3>Developing Enterprise-Ready Plugins</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>My greatest surprise at JUC 2014 in Boston was how many enterprise Jenkins CI users had developed plugins for their own use. I had not pictured enterprise release managers as plugin developers. Here at <a href="https://www.blackducksoftware.com/">Black Duck Software</a>, we developed Jenkins plugins for four years running. Fabrice Solami, a sales engineer, wanted to do more than automate our code scanning tool via a shell script step in the Jenkins job. He wrote a first plugin that added a build step to run the tool and configure the job more comfortably. The plugin became quickly popular, and when customers asked for it to also support maven builds and run on slaves, it was time for help from the engineering team, particularly the integration team I lead.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Over the years we developed four more plugins and overhauled the original one with the user community (aka paying customers) growing to >75 organizations, mostly large or really large development organizations. In the process, we received lots of feedback and discovered some Jenkins features we feel are essential for good plugin design for the enterprise. Let me share these insights so that you can consider them in your plugin development.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><h3>Credentials Plugin</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Our plugins connect to our web applications and need authentication to utilize our SDK. The first plugins used username and password fields in every job configuration. That made tedious configuration work and stores the passwords in clear text in the configuration files on disk. Ouch!</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We did wise up and started using the credentials plugin to manage username/passwords centrally and securely. It even allows setting authorization roles in such a way that the maintainer of a job can use the credentials without seeing the password. With that in place, our plugins are fit for banks and insurance companies and any other security-conscious organization.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><h3>Support the REST API</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Did you know that Jenkins talks REST? We found it to be an easy way to create and update jobs. It is a really handy tool. The REST API is easy to script for all sorts of external interactions.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>However, plugins need to do a little effort to support it on their part; yet it is almost trivial to do. So from our experience it should not be left out.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We wrote a small Java program that reads, creates, updates job configurations, and can trigger job runs. It reads the jobs and commits them to a file for easy mass editing and updates the jobs afterwards.</p><br/>
 <br/>
<p>Our internal use case is to manage regression tests. We have medium-sized lists of jobs that run regression tests. With this tooling we can create a new set of jobs for a given plugin that runs against a new target server, that is, a server version under QA. It all happens in less than 15 minutes.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We also made this part of our migration from our first plugin to its successor with all the enterprise capabilities, but incompatible configuration. Using the REST API and some more Java programs we can create a csv file / Excel spreadsheet with jobs that are configured with the previous plugin. The user can filter the list with the spreadsheet application as needed, and then use the resulting list as input to the batch upgrade tool. This makes the upgrade a gradual affair and not a tedious exercise in UI configuration changes.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><h3>UpdateSites Manager Plugin</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>If you are developing plugins for in-house use, you have the option to install/update those through file upload. However, in an enterprise you likely have multiple Jenkins servers for different divisions, development groups, or regions. The notification of updates becomes tedious at best. Wouldn’t it be nice to run your own update site, so that your plugin(s) become discoverable in the “Available” tab of the “Manage plugins” screen? Wouldn’t it be a dream if available new versions show up automatically in the “Updates” tab, including Jenkins version compatibility check?</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>UpdateSites Manager plugin by IKEDA Yasuyuki is the answer to your prayers. It is easy to install, and the process to create and publish an update site is not too complicated and can become part of your Jenkins job building/releasing the plugin.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-02-1400">my presentation at JUC 2015 West</a>, I’ll share more details on how this makes a difference and how you can use these techniques to make your plugins enterprise-grade. As a bonus, I’ll show you how to get a <a href="https://www.blackducksoftware.com/vulnerability-plugin">free vulnerability report</a> for your Maven or Gradle builds.</p><br/>

<p><h3>Join Me at JUC West to Discuss Building an Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine with Jenkins</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<div style="float:right; margin:1em"><br/>
<img src="http://blog.xebialabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JUc.png" width=333 height=90><br/>

<br/>
<p>After <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east">a great event on the East Coast</a> in June, now over to the West Coast for another exciting <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/">Jenkins User Conference!</a> I'll be there for <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west">JUC West</a> on September 2-3 with the <a href="http://www.xebialabs.com/">XebiaLabs</a> team, and am looking forward to talking to the Jenkins users, partners, developers and community members that will be coming together.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>At JUC East, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMZOnsEuums">talked about the importance of Automated Testing</a> in your Continuous Delivery pipeline, and I was really pleased by the number of interesting discussions and comments that came about as a result.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>For JUC West, I'll be taking a broader view, and will talk about building an "Enterprise Continuous Delivery Machine" around Jenkins. I'm going to focus on the challenge of identifying and choosing solutions for the many "adjacent problem spaces" to Continuous Integration that you run into when trying to move to Continuous Delivery: artifact management, feature tracking, environment provisioning, deployment automation, test management, pipeline orchestration, production feedback and more.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We'll discuss some of the options available for each category, with a special focus on app deployment, test result management and pipeline orchestration. We'll also present a couple of real-world Continuous Delivery Machine architectures, and analyze some of the motivations for each organization's choices.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Most of our users use XebiaLabs tools/products in combination with Jenkins to build out their Continuous Delivery stack. If you’re scaling out your Jenkins usage too, stop by the XebiaLabs booth to see if you can pick up some tips and to say hello.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Look forward to seeing you <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1400">at the event</a>, or check the slides or recording we will post after the event. Hope to see  you there!</p><br/>
