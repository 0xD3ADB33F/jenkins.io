<p>As I mentioned in <a href="/content/fosdem-2016-travel-grant-program">yesterday's post</a>, we're planning a "Contributor Summit" on February 1st, after <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016">FOSDEM 2016</a> (January 30th/31st), to focus on Jenkins 2.0. Since many of us <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016">are already planning</a>, the Monday following the event turned out to be the ideal time to discuss 2.0.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you're not already familiar with some of the key proposals that were put forth, you can review them in the <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposals">Jenkins 2.0 proposals summery page</a>.</p>

<p>We've hosted <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203777932/">one</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/">two</a> Contributor Summits in the past, and they're usually a day-long event where we try to gather a number of Jenkins core/plugin developers and active/power users to have detailed discussions around the theme of the summit. For this "Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit" we do not have a complete agenda yet, but we will post that to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/">Meetup event</a> once it is fully prepared in the next couple weeks.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, we'll be discussing a lot!</p>

<h3 id="venue-and-rsvp">Venue and RSVP</h3>

<p>The Contributor Summit will be hosted in a <a href="https://cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> office at: <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Rue+des+Colonies%2C+11%2C+Belgium%2C+be">Rue des Colonies, 11, Brussels, Belgium</a>. If you're already planning on attending FOSDEM, the office is near Grand Place and Cafe Delerium (where the Friday beer event is hosted).</p>

<p>The venue is of limited size, so if you're planning to join us, <strong>please</strong> RSVP to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/">the Meetup event</a> as soon as you're certain you will be able to attend. If you find yourself unable to attend, please remove yourself from the list to ensure that we can fit as many active contributors into the office as possible!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/St-Petersburg-Jenkins-Meetup/events/226875933/">first Jenkins meetup</a> in Saint Petersburg, Russia took place on December
9th. The event has been organized with the help from <a href="https://yandex.com/company/">Yandex</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a>.</p>

<p>In total there were about 80 attendees at the meetup. In addition to
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/St-Petersburg-Jenkins-Meetup/events/226875933/">meetup.com</a>
the event has been promoted by Yandex so we quickly reached capacity limit.</p>

<p>There were 3 talks conducted, speakers from Yandex, ZeroTurnaround and
CloudBees. We discussed the current open-source project state, ongoing
activities in the community, Jenkins-powered CD case studies from
ZeroTurnaround and Jenkins plugin development approaches.</p>

<p>Although December is a short month due to the holidays, there has been a good
amount of local Jenkins activities that took place regardless of holiday
obligations. Today and tomorrow I will be doing a series of posts to summarize
December JAM World Tour. Special thanks to the JAM organizers and co-organizers
who made it all happen in these cities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lima, Peru</li>
  <li>St.Petersburg, Russia</li>
  <li>Toulouse, France</li>
  <li>Bay Area, CA</li>
</ul>

<p>On December 9 <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Lima JAM</a>
hosted their first Jenkins meetup in Lima, Peru. There were attendance from
various roles of DevOps: Dev, QA, and Ops. There was also a good mixture of
different levels of Jenkins users, some were new and just starting to use
Jenkins while others had extensive Jenkins experience.</p>

<p>The group has been invited by Docker and Ansible meetup organizers for a joint
event in January to showcase technologies from Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.
Congrats to Lima JAM group.</p>

<p>Slides from the meetup can be found
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/eddumelendez/peru-jam-intro">here</a>. Additional shared resources used in
the Lima JAM can be found <a href="http://jenkinsperu.github.io/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> for sponsoring the yummy
burrito bar and offered up their brand new auditorium to host Jenkins
Developers and Users Meetup group on Dec 16. We had 96 RSVPs which was
impressive. Our speaker for the evening was <strong>Akshay Dayal</strong>, Software Engineer at
Google. Akshay's session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided
to scale their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their
security/availability and failover requirements and how heavy automation played
an important role in this effort.</p>

<p>The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config data
externally. Slides are listed below. The video will be posted on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226844066/">the meetup
page</a>) once it becomes
available.</p>

<p>While we are gearing up for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/">FOSDEM 2016</a> early next year in Brussels, I wanted to remind the Jenkins community about our <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program">Travel Grant Program</a>. We're a little late on mentioning it, but the board has allocated the money to help Jenkins contributors travel to Brussels to participate in FOSDEM and the Jenkins Contributor Summit which we will be hosting the day after, Feb 1st, which we'll discuss more in a later blog post.</p>

<p>For the FOSDEM Travel Grant Program, we are able to cover up to $500 (USD) in expenses to help community members participate in FOSDEM.</p>

<p>If you're interested, please read the description of the program below. <strong>Please note that some of the details of the program are different from the linked grant program page</strong></p>

<p>Regardless we hope to see you all at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/">FOSDEM</a> on January 30th and 31st, 2016, in Brussels!</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>All community members are eligible for support unless they've received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event's date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we'll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.</p>

<p>If you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.</p>

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>

<p>The application process for FOSDEM, due to our poor timing, deviates from the traditional <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program">Travel Grant Program</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board">Governance Board</a> at <code>jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com</code> before <strong>January 6th</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>The event you'd like to attend</li>
  <li>The expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)</li>
  <li>A description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:</li>
  <li>Plugins you developed</li>
  <li>Pull requests you authored</li>
  <li>Documentation you wrote</li>
  <li>Public presentations on Jenkins-related topics</li>
  <li>Why should we sponsor your trip?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="applicants-responsibilities">Applicants Responsibilities</h3>

<p>If you've been selected for a travel grant, we'll expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be available for a blog post about this program before the event.</li>
  <li>Help out at the Jenkins <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016">stand at FOSDEM</a></li>
  <li>If your schedule permits, we'd love to see you at the Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit the day after FOSDEM.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should go without saying that we expect all Jenkins contributors representing the project at an event such as FOSDEM to act in a respectful and constructive manner. As we have not yet formally adopted our own <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Code+of+Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, we recommend reviewing the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/practical/conduct/">FOSDEM Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>After the trip, please submit a travel report to <code>jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</code> mailing list. This report should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What you accomplished at the event</li>
  <li>What you learned at the event</li>
  <li>Contacts you made</li>
  <li>Other useful information</li>
</ul>

<p>We also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review. We will reimburse actually incurred costs up to the 500 USD limit.</p>

<p>A lot of people are using the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md">Workflow plugin</a>, but as with any scripting environment, users often have to start from scratch and learn the same lessons and shortcuts that other users have already learned. While there are blog posts from developers and users in various places, and some samples in the Workflow plugin documentation, more examples and tips and tricks are always, always useful. To help with that, we've created the <em><a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples">workflow-examples</a></em> repository on GitHub, as a place to store community-developed Workflow scripts that can help new users get started, show how to accomplish some non-trivial goals, and find tips and trick for taking your Workflow pipeline to the next level.</p>

<p>The repository has four directories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docs/</code> - documentation, guides, and more. Including a <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples/blob/master/docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md">Best Practices document</a>.

<hr />

<p>This year some great new Jenkins features came out of the butler’s goodie bag - amongst them, the most important one being the ability to realize <a href="https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/06/kohsuke-kawaguchi-the-main-challenge-for-jenkins-is-with-itself/">continuous delivery pipeline as code</a>!
The features like Workflow Multibranch, pipeline-as-code (with a marker file that Jenkins looks for in your application’s SCM repository/branch, aptly named Jenkinsfile) are the foundations to making Jenkins super intelligent to automagically create workflows (rather, a CI/CD pipeline) to build your code and orchestrate the work required to drive your application from concept to delivery!</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>The Workflow Multibranch feature (provided by the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin">workflow plugin</a>) provides the following key abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic Workflow (job) creation in Jenkins per new branch in the repo.</li>
  <li>Build specific to that child-branch and its unique scm change and build history.</li>
  <li>Automatic job pruning/deletion for branches deleted from the repository, according to the settings.</li>
  <li>Flexibility to individually configure branch properties, by overriding the parent properties, if required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jenkins pipeline-as-code (concept) enables you to maintain your CI/CD workflow logic in the project/application source code repo with no additional configuration to be maintained per branch in Jenkins.</p>

<p>The Workflow script to build/test/deploy your code is always synchronized with the rest of the source code you are working on.</p>

<p><strong>To demonstrate the concept here</strong> - Let’s use a basic Java Web application project with a Maven pom.xml as shown in the structure below (this is using GitHub as the SCM but you can do this on SVN or Mercurial too).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo">This project</a> has a marker file for Jenkins in the repo - <code>Jenkinsfile</code>.</p>

<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic1.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></center>

<p><strong>So, what's a Jenkinsfile?</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo/blob/master/Jenkinsfile">Jenkinsfile</a> is essentially your Jenkins Workflow, a script, that defines the CI/CD pipeline logic for a project with steps to build/test/deploy etc. captured in various stages.</p>

<p>So for our sample Java web application, a basic Jenkinsfile could be something like -</p>

<pre><code>node {
   // Mark the code checkout 'stage'....
   stage 'Checkout'

   // Checkout code from repository
   checkout scm

   // Get the maven tool.
   // ** NOTE: This 'M3' maven tool must be configured
   // **       in the global configuration.
   def mvnHome = tool 'M3'

   // Mark the code build 'stage'....
   stage 'Build'
   // Run the maven build
   sh "${mvnHome}/bin/mvn clean install"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just having this file in the source code repo root would mean that -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jenkins will automatically recognize this branch and create appropriate jobs by itself.</li>
  <li>Quick, 1-step code checkout using: “checkout scm” in your workflow</li>
  <li>Every time a new change is pushed to this branch, the branch is built and the commit status gets updated.</li>
  <li>When the branch is destroyed in the repository, or if Jenkinsfile is removed, the corresponding job gets destroyed from Jenkins automatically (<em>You can retain these jobs and/or archive the builds for audit/compliance requirements using the retention property - Orphan Item strategy</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> there are various mechanisms to promote reuse of Workflow scripts, such as the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/cps-global-lib/README.md">Workflow Global Library</a>.</p>

<h3 id="required-jenkins-configuration">Required Jenkins configuration</h3>

<p>Make sure you’ve the latest <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin">Workflow</a> and (v1.11 as of writing this blog) Workflow Multibranch plugins installed on your Jenkins instance</p>

<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic2.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></center>

<p>Also, ensure that other dependencies, like SCM plugins and build tools, are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Either SVN/Git/Mercurial (depending on your SCM)</li>
  <li>GitHub Branch Source Plugin (optimized to use the GitHub API and improve performance)</li>
  <li>Maven build tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Then create a new <em>Multibranch Workflow</em> Job with configuration as shown below - mainly selecting the Branch Sources (Git, in this example) and providing the branch/repo URL with credentials.</p>

<p><em>Branch sources</em> (Git) - <code>https://github.com/kishorebhatia/pipeline-as-code-demo</code> (or a repo where you’ve cloned this source code with Jenkinsfile)</p>

<p>Leave all other properties default and <em>Save</em>.</p>

<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic3.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></center>

<p>You’ll observe that Jenkins would perform Branch Indexing on that “cd” job folder and start the workflow for the master branch, with an automatically created new job, named master, under the “cd” folder.</p>

<p>The workflow does a dummy step for application deploys to the environments in this sequence <em>Staging</em> -&gt; Waits for manual approval -&gt; <em>PROD</em></p>

<p>Now, let’s create a new branch off of this master branch in your cloned git repo:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$ git branch newBranch</code> (create a newBranch)</li>
  <li><code>$ git checkout newBranch</code> (switches to newBranch)</li>
  <li><code>$ git push --set-upstream origin newBranch</code> (pushes newBranch)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll observe that your Jenkins instance automatically picks up this newBranch and starts running the workflow (with the Jenkinsfile in this newBranch) to build/test/deploy the code.</p>

<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/pipeline-as-code-guest-blog/Pic4.png" width="600" border="0" /></a></center>

<p>Next, if you now delete this <code>newBranch</code> (<code>git branch -D newBranch</code>), Jenkins will automatically remove the orphan Workflow job for <code>newBranch</code>. You can retain these jobs even after the branches are deleted using the <em>Orphaned Item Strategy</em> property in the main "cd" job’s configuration.</p>

<p>So we observed the following benefits of this pipeline-as-code approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overall job definition is a script (Jenkinsfile)</li>
  <li>Calls your build tools and scripts for details</li>
  <li>The build script can be versioned alongside project sources</li>
  <li>Jenkins handles feature/experimental branches automatically</li>
  <li>Keep less configuration in <code>$JENKINS_HOME</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dockerized-demo-environment">Dockerized Demo environment</h3>

<p>You can also use the following docker image to run this demo with a preconfigured Jenkins environment and the sample job: <code>jenkinsci/workflow-demo</code> (i.e. <code>docker pull jenkinsci/workflow-demo</code>)</p>

<p>This docker container includes Jenkins with Workflow and Workflow Multibranch plugins, a local git repo with the aforementioned Java web application and Jetty to demonstrate a continuous delivery pipeline of this application deployed and tested across multiple environments in the pipeline with an approval gate before promoting to PROD (like QA, Staging and PROD).</p>

<p>There's a "cd" job pre-configured as a multibranch Workflow job.</p>

<p>Launch the docker demo as: <code>docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 9418:9418 -ti jenkinsci/workflow-demo</code></p>

<p>Now, you can access Jenkins on port 8080 and Jetty on port 8081 from localhost or the IP of your boot2docker/docker-machine environment.</p>

<p>The demo container has a local git repo so you can clone: <code>git://localhost/repo</code>. When creating new branches, each branch automatically creates a matching subproject in Jenkins and triggers the build for that branch. The workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Checks out source code from the same repository and commit as <code>Jenkinsfile</code>.</li>
  <li>Builds sources via Maven with unit testing.</li>
  <li>Runs two parallel integration tests that involve deploying the app to ephemeral server instances, which get thrown away when tests are done (this is done by using auto-deployment of Jetty)</li>
  <li>Once integration tests are successful, the webapp gets to the staging server at <a href="http://localhost:8081/staging/">localhost:8081/staging</a> (or your docker-machine/boot2docker instance IP)</li>
  <li>requires a human to Manually inspect the staging instance, and when ready, approves the deployment to the production server at http://localhost:8081/production/</li>
</ul>
