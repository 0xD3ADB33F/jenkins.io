What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation
virtually any project

Jenkins Office Hours, now officially a bi-weekly event
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
In May, we launched <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">Jenkins Office Hours</a>.  This was inspired by <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby">Jenkins Ruby hack sessions</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cowboyd">cowboyd</a>, and the idea is to use an interactive online meeting to drive some sub-projects, bootstrap new plugin developers by pointing them to the right extension points, and/or bringing existing community members to discuss some specific key parts of Jenkins and its plugins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Office+Hours+Week+20">first</a> <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dev+Office+Hours+Week+20">two</a> meetings were very popular, but our trial WebEx account expired, and since then we were looking for a sponsor to host this event. And I am happy to report that with a help from Max Spring, now we can get the office hours going again.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So the Jenkins office hours will be bi-weekly events, starting this Wednesday (6/29). <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">See the wiki page</a> for details and agenda</a>. Looking forward to seeing you!<br/>

Ruby Plugins Hack Session Notes 6/23/2011
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>You know that the night is going to be productive whenever @kohsukekawa shows up, and last night was no exception. We talked about problems on the horizon, potential solutions, and then I spent the last half hour ripping a bit of code.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that most of the changes that have to be done to Jenkins core have already been made, so now the bulk of the heavy lifting falls to the Ruby side of things (right now, me).</p>

<p>Anyhow, on to the notes!</p>

<h2 id="attendees">Attendees</h2>

<p>@kohsukekawa, @cowboyd</p>

<h3 id="extract-more-stuff-into-the-jenkins-pluginsrb-support-library-cowboyd">extract more stuff into the jenkins-plugins.rb support library (@cowboyd)</h3>

<p>We're in the process of extracting, normalizing, documenting all the goop that's currently residing in the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-ruby-plugins-playground">ruby plugins playground</a> into a formal plugin support gem called jenkins-plugins <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb">https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb</a></p>

<h3 id="recruit-rubyists-to-implement-non-jenkins-specific-code-kohsukekawa">recruit Rubyists to implement non-Jenkins specific code (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>If you know Ruby and would like to be able to write Jenkins plugins with it, but don't know the first thing about Jenkins and/or JRuby, that's OK. You can help by implementing some of the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb/tree/master/features">cucumber features</a> found in that repo</p>

<p>@kohsukekawa is going to be knocking on your door to ask if you're ready to step up, so I hope you've been nice this year!</p>

<h3 id="testing-strategy-cowboyd-kohsukekawa">testing strategy (@cowboyd, @kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>Ruby folk love their tests, and a plugin develompent solution won't be complete unless testing is a breeze. That means that as we extract the plugin support library, we take make sure you can test plugin classes in isolation.</p>

<p>On the Jenkins side, KK will think about how to run tests that require a full Jenkins environment. A system like this exists currently for testing java plugins, but some thought might be required on how to do this for Ruby.</p>

<h3 id="packaging-reloaded-kohsukekawa">packaging reloaded (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>KK is going to jump in and write some rake tasks to take a ruby plugin structure and package it into a valid .hpi file, and with no maven involved.  According to him, Ruby plugins aren't the only system that wants to run maven-free. There is desire to be able to do plugin development with Gradle (another Java build system), so this could be a double win.</p>

<h3 id="different-schedule-kohsukekawa">different schedule (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>8:30pm Central in North America, doesn't seem to be a very good time. Especially for hackers in Asia Pacific. KK will investigate a new time that works for everybody and encourages more participation.</p>

<a href='/blog/2011/06/16/jenkins-long-term-support-release/'>
Jenkins Long-Term Support Release
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have released <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">1.409.1, our first long-term support (LTS) release</a>, from the Jenkins project.</p>

<p>The idea of the LTS release is to provide a second release line the favors more stability and bug fix only maintenance. This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We'll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we'll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line">see Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I'm calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it'd be great to get more people on board, as I think it'll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code. You'll also have a say on what bugs need to be backcported, etc. If you are interested in this effort, please let us know.</p>

Upcoming Events in June and early July
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>I've just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/calendar">the Jenkins calendar</a>. Conveniently, they are all events I'll be attending while traveling around Western Europe!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://jugcologne.org">The Cologne JUG</a> is having a meetup on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We'll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/jugc-jenkins-town-763587">Xing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I'll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we'll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/jenkins-treffen-munchen-30-06-2011-776226">Xing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We'll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more information and sign up at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Integration-London/events/21752121/">Meetup</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have a Jenkins event you'd like to have added to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/calendar">our calendar</a>? Let us know!</p>

A big thanks to Rackspace
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This post is long over-due and I really apologize for that.</p>

<p>Some months ago we put out the call for "more slave machines!" through the
mailing lists, sky-writers and twitter. We had a serious problem, for a
continuous integration project, a <strong>large</strong> number of our plugins and
dependencies weren't being built in a continuous and automated fashion!</p>

<p>We had some builds on a couple of flakey machines on home connections
contributed by various individuals, until Rackspace stepped up in a <strong>big</strong>
way and donated an infrastructure server for the project to use.</p>

<center><a href="http://rackspace.com/?jenkins" target="_blank"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/rackspace.jpg" width="200" border="0" /></a></center>

<p>For months now, just about all plugins and core have been built and tested on <code>spinach</code>,
the always-on machine in the Rackspace Cloud. Dutifully chugging away building
core, plugin after plugin and occasionally getting flooded with work from <a href="http://twitter.com/fcamblor">Frederic
Camblor's</a> plugin compatibility tester!</p>

<p>In hindsight, having a powerful infrastructure machine for nothing other than
builds has helped us build great software faster; I can't imagine how difficult
things might be otherwise.</p>

<p>I've personally had a lot of interaction with Rackspace engineers through the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack
project</a> and have a number of friends who operate businesses on
Rackspace/Rackspace Cloud hybrid infrastructures.</p>

<p>The folks at Rackspace are
top notch and I can't thank them enough for contributing to the Jenkins
project.</p>
