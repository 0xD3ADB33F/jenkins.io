What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.

Jenkins project meeting in the meat space / Call for agenda
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">bi-weekly IRC meeting</a> where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project running.</p>

<p>Next Sunday, we'll bring this project meeting live to <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don't normally come to these meetings, I'd like to encourage everyone to propose agenda items and add it to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda#GovernanceMeetingAgenda-JenkinsUserConferenceMeeting@SanFrancisco">the agenda page</a>.</p>

<p>The Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what it is like. But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you'd like to get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on things, please don't hesitate to add them.</p>

<p>I still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over with IRC — I'd like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I'd like either real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live broadcasting of the room.</p>

... and be a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA agent</a> too! If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Just Do It!<br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Admittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find an organizer or two</b>. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists">Jenkins Dev email list</a> and on your Twitter account using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23JenkinsCI">#JenkinsCI</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Let the Jenkins project know</b>. <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">Let</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev/topics">us</a> <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat ">know</a> so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional slaves I mean helpers in your city. And if you're recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Decide how often you want to meet</b>. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Go to Meetup.com</b>. We have <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/">an account that we can let you use</a>, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Determine the topic for your first meetup</b>. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you'll have an automatic pool of interested parties.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Come up with a format for the meetup</b>. Here's an idea for a schedule: <br/>
6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies<br/>
6:30-6:35: Announcements<br/>
6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)<br/>
7:15-7:30: Q&A<br/>
7:30: Wrap up, chat<br/>
8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find a venue, preferably a free one</b>. Ideally, your company or one you know can         host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Ask a company or two to sponsor the meetup</b>, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they're hiring, and to support         the Jenkins community in general.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Plan the room logistics</b>. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It's a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Get the word out in any way you can</b>. Some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Tell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.<br/>
<li>If you use Meetup.com, they'll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they'll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.<br/>
<li>Email folks at         your company who might be interested<br/>
<li>Email friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word<br/>
<li>Post the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles<br/>
<li>If you know of         any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post         your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may                 receive.<br/>
</ol><br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
Additional tips:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Get someone to record the event. Doesn't have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if         you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.<br/>
<li>Plan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won't make it. It's a free event, and plans         tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.<br/>
<li>Remember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or         other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you're probably fine with beer, Coke and water.<br/>
<li>Bring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).<br/>
<li>Consider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even         their product or service).<br/>
<li>At the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to         cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).<br/>
<li>Vary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.<br/>
<li>Start and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.<br/>
<li>Join forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups!         For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.<br/>

Last week, <a href="http://www.praqma.com/">praqma</a> was organizing in Copenhague a "Jenkins User Event". A User Event, compared to JenkinsConf, is a lighter meeting with (suposed to be) reduced costs organized by volunteers. Praqma got sponsorship from both <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> and <a href="http://www.programmingresearch.com/">Programing Research</a> so that they can book a high quality conference room and prepare a nice meeting with all commodities.<br /><br/>

That was my first travel to Danemark. I enjoyed the winds-farm on northern sea as well as the duty-free lego shop at airport, but didn't have much time to discover the city - so will have to come back next year ;)<br /><br/>

Thursday was about a <a href="http://www.praqma.com/jcicodecamp12">Jenkins Code Camp</a> (aka "hackathon"), that I joined late at 2pm due to flight being delayed. 20 geeks were talking about some technical issues, new features, implementation strategies for a large set of topics. I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558">creating a new extension</a> point in jenkins-core. Those already confident with jenkins development helped to write this code, some discovered the extension point design as well as way to contribute to jenkins (github pull request, etc), some were looking at jenkins source code for first time so learned a lot.<br /><br/>

Friday was the Jenkins User Event. To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was "packed" into&nbsp;afternoon. This let praqma get a "reasonable" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing !<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Conference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees.<br /><br/>
<br style="clear: both;" /><br/>
After&nbsp;Lars Kruse&nbsp;welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
The rest of the conference was single-track.<br /><br/>

<br /><br/>
1rst session was about "<i>facilitate strategic reuse of software</i>" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said "Clearcase facilitated" sharing components &nbsp;-I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Tales from the trenches</i>" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase,&nbsp;<u>helping a lot</u> early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, "some tools a radically better" and "deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal".<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Continuous Code Inspection</i>" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>

<br /><br/>
Coffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ...<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Sony was presenting its "<i>Huge Jenkins Cluster</i>", with 4 master, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 slaves, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated slave machine with android devices connected through USB.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Such a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
With 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a slave is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Remaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins master and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Next talk was mine, exposing <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb">Jenkins Enterprise</a> and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb">pre-tested commits</a>. Hope you enjoyed the talk.<br /><br/>

This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source :<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>costs - for sure,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>but also open standards and interoperability,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>and contribution to public good.&nbsp;</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
This last point distinguish "<i>innovators</i>" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and "<i>free riders</i>" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what "contributing" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;)<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>

Meeting ended with a "socialize" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches. A nice time to discuss with speakers, know a face to match an #irc nickname, discuss about everything geeks like to discuss about, and round off this pleasant day.<br />

<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference</a> is back to San Francisco after a world tour. The conference is on the 30th of this month (Sunday), which makes it back to back with JavaOne, just like the last year. This schedule allows the community people from all over the world to attend and talk, so you see speakers from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JevgeniKabanov">different part</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#BaruchSadogursky">the world</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
You can see <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">the agenda and the speaker list here</a>, there's a number of speakers from the big/serious users of Jenkins in the bay area, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JustinRyan">NetFlix</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#MaxSpring">Cisco</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JamesBlair">HP</a>. All of these guys not only just use Jenkins but wrote additional plugins/programs to really tailor Jenkins into fitting their needs, and I think those would be really informative for those who are already using Jenkins, as well as those who are thinking about using Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This time we also have a couple of talks that discuss how to develop plugins. In JUC Israel, I was pleasantly surprised that a talk on this topic attracted a lot of people! If you are interested in writing a plugin, this would be a great chance to get started.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are also trying to bring <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">the Jenkins project meeting</a>, which normally happens in IRC, into the real world in this conference. We are hoping that this would allow those who don't normally come to the meeting to voice their thoughts. If you are interested, feel free to add stuff to the agenda list!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And oh, did you check out who's on the sponsors list this year?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I hope I convinced you that you must come to this conference &mdash; if so, <a href="http://juc-san-francisco-september-2012-eorg.eventbrite.com/">please register</a>. I've been told that right now you can use the promotion code <tt>JUC-2012SF</tt> to cut the price in half, so please use it while it still works!<br/>

<p>Recently, Jenkins User Conference organizer Alyssa Tong sent out the following request:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenkins User Conf SF is looking for volunteers to help us record the                                                                                        <br />
sessions. Pls drop me an email if you're able to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're trying to make sure we can capture video of as much of this year's conference as possible, but the only way we can do that is with your help!</p>

<p>If you'll be in town for JavaOne, or just live in the bay area, drop Alyssa an email at <code>atong@cloudbees.com</code>.</p>

Report: Intro to Jenkins meet-up in Copenhagen
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have hosted two informal meetups introducing Jenkins Continuous Integration Server.</p>

<p>The first in end of June (announced here on this blog) and the second on the 7th of August. The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days before, but had very good attendance  - the second was completely booked (15 seats).</p>

<p>The agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about Jenkins and finally a live demo.
The live demo starts from scratch by downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.</p>

<p>The meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola. The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.</p>

<p>As the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.</p>

<p>The meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.</p>

<p>These informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as it  is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.</p>

<p>Because these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other topics.</p>

<p>If you're interested in more Jenkins and CI related meet-ups in the Copenhagen area, visit <a href="http://www.praqma.net">our homepage</a> or follow the <code>#pragma</code> hashtag on Twitter.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href="http://www.praqma.net/jciusrcph12">Jenkins User Event in Copenhagen</a> coming in September.</p>

<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/category/tags/juc">Jenkins User Conference</a> is touring around the world and coming back to San Francisco for this September, colocated with JavaOne.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And here is <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">the call for papers</a> &mdash; we'd love users and plugin developers to share their experience with others. Please tell us how you combine plugins in an interesting way, how some of the features in Jenkins did or did not work for you, tricks you use to effectively manage Jenkins instances, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I personally know many bay area tech companies that depend heavily on Jenkins. Really looking forward to hearing from you!

I'm back from the latest Jenkins User Conference in Israel, and I had such a fun (except the part where I strained my lower back on the day I head back to home so 10+5 hour flights were a torture.) I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach.<br/>

For me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house. Needless to say I took a lot of pictures. Hudson was great, and I got a wet-wipe in the end to wipe my hands off with Hudson.<br/>

After I and Shlomi have done the keynote, Amir from HP did a wonderful job showing off how he uses the multi-configuration project type (AKA "matrix project".) This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks.<br/>

Sacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing &mdash; if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4.<br/>

Eyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.)<br/>

Another talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call "super Jenkins admins" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins. And those those extra finish makes all the difference!<br/>
