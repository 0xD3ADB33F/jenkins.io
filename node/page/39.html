<a href='/blog/2010/04/12/pre-tested-commits-with-git/'>
Pre-tested commits with Git
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>At the first <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/BayAreaMeetup">Bay Area Hackathon</a> in mid-2009, the topic du jour was "<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Designing+pre-tested+commit">pre-tested commits</a>." As potential implementations of the concept were discussed over burgers from <a id="aptureLink_gLlt1i6v1p" href="http://www.brickhousesf.com/">Brickhouse</a> in downtown San Francisco, we realized as a group a few things: first, those burgers were <em>delicious</em>, but more importantly: pre-testing commits is very-SCM dependent and involves a lot of moving parts. One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for "Concurrent Builds", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different slaves, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.</p>

<p>Chances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.</p>

<p>With Git, and the phenomenal code review tool <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a>, and the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin">Gerrit plugin</a> by intrepid plugin developer, <a href="http://twitter.com/jyrkiputtonen">Jyrki Puttonen</a>, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit <em>are</em> possible.
<!--break-->
For Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has <a id="aptureLink_MoOPmIyV3m" href="http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/">JGit</a>, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an <code>sshd</code> stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a "regular" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won't delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dev creates a topic branch to work on a change</li>
  <li>Code is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally</li>
  <li>Dev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit</li>
  <li>Hudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as "+1 Verified" or "-1 Fails"</li>
  <li>If the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with <a id="aptureLink_YL8glbfS7G" href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">git-rebase(1)</a>)</li>
  <li>If Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>To learn more about Gerrit, check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">project page on Google Code</a>; information on the Gerrit plugin can be <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin">found on the wiki</a>.</p>

Kohsuke leaves Sun

<div class='content'>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skrb/2504160293/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2504160293_977ddbf22d_m_d.jpg" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" /></a>Those of you on the <code>users@</code> or <code>dev@</code> mailing lists have likely already read that Kohsuke (<em>left in the photo</em>), the founder of the Hudson project, <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/05/good-bye-sunoracle">is leaving Sun</a>. I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.</p>

<p>Per Kohsuke's post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where am I heading next? I'm actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means for Hudson still isn't certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host <a id="aptureLink_K18yj8JkNK" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/atlassian">JIRA</a>, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.</p>

<p>The next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you'll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the <a id="aptureLink_oaxbhP0dAz" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account. I'll let Kohsuke finish this post off:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn't be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I'm a part of it.</p>

Regarding the start of April
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>I had briefly contemplating what sort of silly posts I could write to celebrate April Fool's Day, when I sat down to write out some of them, I got a few sentences in and decided that they just weren't funny enough. Either I have very high standards, or I'm terribly unfunny.</p>

<p>The web is awash with April Fool's articles, comics, headlines and everything else, so instead I'm going to just give you a few useful links.</p>

<p><strong>A couple of Twitter links</strong></p>

<p>Besides the <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> account, you can also follow a couple of Hudson's more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our benevolent dictator, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/bshine">Ben Shine</a> from Yahoo! who's been working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there's <a href="http://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Ferguson Smart</a> who's been working on a <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book">Hudson book</a>. Of course I've tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible in the <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/contributors">@contributors Twitter list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hacking Hudson</strong></p>

<p>When starting to hack Hudson, it's useful to start by understanding <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Building+Hudson">how to build Hudson</a>. If hacking Hudson's core isn't your cup of tea, you can always start with the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugin+tutorial">plugin tutorial</a> and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you're hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/">online Javadocs for Hudson</a></p>

<p><strong>Communicate</strong>
The two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing%20List">mailing lists</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">IRC channel</a>. During "regular business hours" for the pacific standard time zone, you can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your queries.</p>

<p>I'd list more, but I'm too busy reading about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/exclusive-google-to-go-nuclear/">Google's nuclear weapons program</a>. ;)

Announcing the Hudson 2.0 Roadmap
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/java-evil-edition.png" align="right" />There have been numerous discussions on the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing%20List">mailing lists</a> over the past couple months regarding memory issues, speed regressions and a number of other issues regarding performance of Hudson, particularly under high load. In an effort to address these concerns, the Hudson core team has <a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg">announced</a> a roadmap for <strong>Hudson 2.0</strong>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg">message</a> to the <code>dev@</code> mailing list, Kohsuke said of Hudson 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it stands now Hudson 1.0 is a good proof of concept, it's time to take the lessons learned and build a truly solid enterprise-ready continuous integration server
<!--break-->
Some notable points from Kohsuke's announcement with regards to the Hudson 2.0 roadmap, which is expected to ship late Q4 2011, are:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of <code>core</code> in portable C for greater speed and code readability</li>
  <li>Selection of a better license, namely the <a id="aptureLink_WU0wj407g6" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">WTFPL</a></li>
  <li>Revamped storage architecture around the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/standard_edition.html">Oracle 11g Database</a> to provide more optimal synergy over flat XML files.</li>
  <li>Embedding the Mono, Python, V8 and Lua engines allowing plugins to be written in C#, Python, JavaScript or Lua.</li>
  <li>Adoption of the Hudson <a href="http://randomfunnypicture.com/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/haters-gonna-hate-eagle.jpg">Eagle</a> as a mascot instead of the butler</li>
  <li>"Social" support will be merged into <code>core</code>, integrating Hudson directly with Facebook so you can share test failures with your friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hudson 2.0 is expected to follow in the intrepid footsteps of other major revamps such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_5">Netscape 5</a> and <a id="aptureLink_LVKY9sDfJM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl%206">Perl 6</a> in its ambitiousness and innovation.</p>

Hudson 1.353 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_soap.jpg" align="left" width="170" hspace="4" vspace="4" /> This week's release comes slightly later than usual and is mostly a clean-up of a few bugs. Due to a problem with the Kohsuke's <a href="http://github.com/kohsuke/hudson">GitHub mirror</a> of Hudson's core, I can't mine the commits for interesting information as per usual so you'll just have to trust that Hudson 1.353 is chock full of good, wholesome bug fixes. If the problem persists next week, I'll find a better way to dig up information on particularly releases that doesn't depend on the GitHub mirror.</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Bugs fixed
&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Tagging a repository can result in NPE.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Fix possible form submission error when using multiple combobox elements.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6025">issue 6025</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Better escaping of test case names in test results pages.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5982">issue 5982</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Make radio buttons work in repeatable content, such as a build step.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5028">issue 5028</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;</p>

<pre><code>Fixed the handling of verifying that the POM path entered for Maven projects exists.
(&lt;a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-4693"&gt;issue 4693&lt;/a&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<h4 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Added link to builds in buildTimeTrend
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-3993">issue 3993</a>)
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You can go grab the <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war">latest .war file</a> straight from <code>hudson-ci.org</code> or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.</p>

Screencast: Python on Hudson (Part 1)
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>After Hudson got some major publicity <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon">at PyCon Atlanta 2010</a> I haven't been as quick as I would have liked with Python-related posts and tutorials. I use Hudson to build and test a number of pure Python modules and C extensions across numerous Python versions (covering 2.4 - 3.1). For most beginners, or those simply looking to get started with Python on Hudson, starting with my job configurations is too much at once, so instead I wanted to start at the "beginning" so to speak.</p>

<p>The trouble with getting people started with Hudson, given how simple and visual it is to use, is that articles with sample configurations are not particularly useful; a screencast however is a good medium for visually walking somebody through Hudson. The screencast below (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-P4j5n_No">also on YouTube</a>) is the <em>first</em> in a series of screencasts I'll be doing, not only for Python on Hudson, but for Hudson overall. It is just over four minutes long, and covers setting up a simple continuous integration job for the <a href="http://eventlet.net">Eventlet</a> library (which is hosted <a href="http://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet/">on Bitbucket</a>)</p>

Resurgence of Releng

<div class='content'>
<p>A few weeks ago I passed a job listing that I had found through one of my <strong>many</strong> Google Alerts for Hudson-related queries to Andrew (<code>abayer</code>), following up on one of those job listings Andrew recently signed an offer to join the nice folks over at Digg to be their resident "build guy." On its own I thought "great for Andrew!" and nothing more, then I saw <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bi58m/anyone_here_a_build_engineer_or_part_of_the_build/">this thread</a> on reddit which poses the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone here a build engineer, or part of the build team? Could you please share your experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems, to me at least, the notion of "release engineering" is making a come-back, particularly in the aging "Web 2.0" world where companies like Digg, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc are anywhere from five to ten years old. As these companies have aged a couple of important things have happened, their code-base has aged increasing the possibility of bitrot, but they have also expanded in terms of headcount. Start-ups that might have once slighted larger corporations like Oracle, Cisco VMWare and IBM for their burdensome process and longer release schedules now find themselves ensnared with massive code bases, larger development teams and complicated deployments.</p>

<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_vs_buildbot.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_vs_buildbot.png" width="555" /></a></center>

<p>Over the past few months we've seen Hudson being used in a number of different contexts, it was <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon">pitched at PyCon</a> as part of a larger appeal to the Python community to get on the continuous integration bandwagon, we've seen a few posts from developers using Hudson for testing and packaging <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/getting-started-building-android-apps-hudson">Android</a> and <a href="http://manicwave.com/blog/2010/03/01/that-feels-better-cocoa-hudson-and-running-green/">iPhone apps</a>, .NET developers are <a href="http://blog.bobcravens.com/2010/03/01/GettingStartedWithCIUsingHudsonForYourNETProjects.aspx">jumping on board as well</a>. Across the board it feels like Hudson is being more and more widely used, it is no longer the mainstay of the Java shop's toolkit, it's become a must have for <em>all</em> developers.</p>

<p>With the allure of <a href="http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/">continuous deployment</a> and Hudson's lowered barrier to entry for testing, packaging and automating releases, is release engineering making a comeback?</p>

This Week in Plugins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>I apologize for the lack of posts this week, I've been quite pre-occupied and a quirk in the <a href="http://github.com/rtyler/continuous-blog-tools/blob/master/twipFromSvn.py">twipFromSvn.py</a> script prevented the generation of this post's contents earlier; thanks to <a id="aptureLink_UwC8b9rCqW" href="http://twitter.com/rpetti">rpetti</a> it works again!</p>

<p>This week was an interesting week in plugin development, a slight regression in the release of <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Jabber+Plugin">Jabber notifier plugin</a> 1.7 resulted in the rapid release of a 1.8 release by <code>kutzi</code>. The <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Fitnesse+Plugin">Fitnesse plugin</a> saw multiple releases again this week, along with the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Libvirt+Slaves+Plugin">Libvirt Slaves plugin</a> which has seen an amazing number of releases since it burst onto the plugin scene <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/week-plugins-4">two weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>There were a few new and notable plugins released this week such as the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/iPhoneView+Plugin">iPhoneView plugin</a> which adds a fancy view to make checking Hudson all that prettier on an iPhone or iPod Touch, the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/XShell+Plugin">cross-platform shell plugin</a> was released, aiming to solve the problem of running a job on both Windows and Unix slaves. My favorite new plugin release this week has to be the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin">Gerrit plugin</a> which made its debut and shows a lot of potential to enable the "pre-tested commit" workflow with Git and <a id="aptureLink_NREODpoWf6" href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a>
