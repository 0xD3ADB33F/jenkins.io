Hudson 1.355 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_street.jpg" align="right" hspace="3" width="150" /> The release of 1.355 came out earlier this week but I hadn't had the chance to write anything up about it. Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the data center migration going on, I won't be able to release #hudsonci today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won't go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here's the breakdown of 1.355
<!--break-->
#### Bugs fixed
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Colored ball image at top of build pages was broken for Hudson in some web
    containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008).
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2341">issue 2341</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Console page while build is running did not wrap lines when viewed in IE.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5869">issue 5869</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Make <tt>dropdownList</tt> work in repeatable content, such as a build step.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fixed a bug where a job created via XML didn't properly receive upstream/downstream computation.
    (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Hudson-API-td1747758.html#a1747758">report</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Argument masking wasn't working correctly for commands run on slaves
    (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Password-masking-when-running-commands-on-a-slave-tp1753033p1753033.html">report</a>)
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<h4 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Added the slave retention strategy based on a schedule.
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Added to configure charset option of Mailer.
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You can go grab the <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war">latest .war file</a> straight from <code>hudson-ci.org</code> or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.</p>

Hudson 1.354 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/scenic_hudson.png" align="right" hspace="3" />Hear ye, hear ye! Behold, the first release of Hudson <em>ever</em> made by a not-employed-by-Sun <a id="aptureLink_7UNdgyqEaS" href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> (as we <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/kohsuke-leaves-sun">covered last week</a>). This iteration of Hudson contains only bug fixes, check the listing below for the specifics on which bugs have been fixed (1.355 is looking like it will contain a number of fixes as well). The release of 1.354 comes slightly later than usual given some of the logistics that needed to, or still need to be resolved.</p>

<p>One of the infrastructure issues that's half-way resolved is the question of Debian/Ubuntu packages. Kohuske has packages uploaded in an experimental <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/debian/">apt repository on hudson-labs.org</a> which you can try out. That said, it's not entirely clear whether this is going to be the preferred means of distributing native Debian/Ubuntu packages in the future (your mileage may vary).
<!--break-->
#### Bugs fixed
&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    POM parsing was still using the module root as the base for relative paths for alternate settings files.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6080">issue 6080</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fix dynamic updates of build history table when <a id="aptureLink_MAx8CeZUo3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site%20request%20forgery">CSRF</a> protection is turned on.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6072">issue 6072</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Improved the error reporting mechanism in LDAP setting.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Raw console output contains garbage.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6034">issue 6034</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fixed a file handle leak in the slave connection.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6137">issue 6137</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Quiet period wasn't taking effect properly when doing parameterized builds.
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/04/16/a-new-blog-for-kohsuke/'>
A new blog for Kohsuke
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Historically, our fearless leader Kohsuke has blogged <a href="http://www.java.net/blog/kohsuke">on Java.net</a>. The setup made a whole lot of sense when Kohsuke was employed by Sun, then Oracle, which sponsors and runs <a href="http://java.net">Java.net</a>. In a post earlier this week discussing <a href="http://www.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/14/hudson-console-markups">console markups</a>, Kohsuke casually pointed out that he will be cross-posting to Java.net, and his personal blog located at <a href="http://kohsuke.org">kohsuke.org</a>. The <a href="http://kohsuke.org/2010/04/12/hello/">first post</a> over on Kohsuke.org welcomes us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the longest time I haven’t really done anything about kohsuke.org, but as I left Sun/Oracle, I decided to put a bit more effort into it. So this is the new home.</p>

  <p>For the time being, I plan to post my blogs both on java.net and here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're a reader of feeds, I recommend adding the <a href="http://kohsuke.org/feed/">rss feed</a> for the blog to your list of interesting continuous integration/hacker feeds.</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/04/12/pre-tested-commits-with-git/'>
Pre-tested commits with Git
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>At the first <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/BayAreaMeetup">Bay Area Hackathon</a> in mid-2009, the topic du jour was "<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Designing+pre-tested+commit">pre-tested commits</a>." As potential implementations of the concept were discussed over burgers from <a id="aptureLink_gLlt1i6v1p" href="http://www.brickhousesf.com/">Brickhouse</a> in downtown San Francisco, we realized as a group a few things: first, those burgers were <em>delicious</em>, but more importantly: pre-testing commits is very-SCM dependent and involves a lot of moving parts. One of the positive changes that came out shortly after the meet up was the support for "Concurrent Builds", allowing a job to be executed concurrently on different slaves, a precursor to pre-tested commit support. Fervor for the pre-tested commit feature lowered as time went on, the feature being too dependent on the SCM itself was generally accepted as the reasoning behind the feature languishing.</p>

<p>Chances are the feature is in fact too large for Hudson to support alone. It requires Hudson, the SCM and likely a third tool to work in concert together to perform such a feat.</p>

<p>With Git, and the phenomenal code review tool <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a>, and the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin">Gerrit plugin</a> by intrepid plugin developer, <a href="http://twitter.com/jyrkiputtonen">Jyrki Puttonen</a>, pre-tested commits with Hudson, Git and Gerrit <em>are</em> possible.
<!--break-->
For Git users more familiar with the distributed Git workflows, working with Gerrit should seem familiar. Gerrit has <a id="aptureLink_MoOPmIyV3m" href="http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/">JGit</a>, a Java implementation of Git embedded within it, along with an <code>sshd</code> stack, meaning Gerrit can masquerade as a "regular" Git remote repository. Developers can push and pull to the repository just as they can with any other Git repository (provided they have permissions of course). I won't delve too much into using Gerrit specifically here, but the pre-tested workflow with Gerrit and Hudson would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dev creates a topic branch to work on a change</li>
  <li>Code is written (and hopefully tested) and committed locally</li>
  <li>Dev pushes commit(s) to Gerrit</li>
  <li>Hudson job (set to Poll SCM) picks up the patch, runs the job and marks it as "+1 Verified" or "-1 Fails"</li>
  <li>If the job fails or is unstable, the change should be reworked or corrected (typically with <a id="aptureLink_YL8glbfS7G" href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">git-rebase(1)</a>)</li>
  <li>If Hudson says the change is good to go, it can be cherry-picked or pulled directly from Gerrit.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
<center><a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/gerrit_patch.png" width="520" /></a></center>

<p>To learn more about Gerrit, check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">project page on Google Code</a>; information on the Gerrit plugin can be <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin">found on the wiki</a>.</p>

Kohsuke leaves Sun

<div class='content'>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skrb/2504160293/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2504160293_977ddbf22d_m_d.jpg" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" /></a>Those of you on the <code>users@</code> or <code>dev@</code> mailing lists have likely already read that Kohsuke (<em>left in the photo</em>), the founder of the Hudson project, <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/05/good-bye-sunoracle">is leaving Sun</a>. I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.</p>

<p>Per Kohsuke's post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where am I heading next? I'm actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means for Hudson still isn't certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host <a id="aptureLink_K18yj8JkNK" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/atlassian">JIRA</a>, this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.</p>

<p>The next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you'll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the <a id="aptureLink_oaxbhP0dAz" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account. I'll let Kohsuke finish this post off:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn't be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I'm a part of it.</p>

Regarding the start of April
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>I had briefly contemplating what sort of silly posts I could write to celebrate April Fool's Day, when I sat down to write out some of them, I got a few sentences in and decided that they just weren't funny enough. Either I have very high standards, or I'm terribly unfunny.</p>

<p>The web is awash with April Fool's articles, comics, headlines and everything else, so instead I'm going to just give you a few useful links.</p>

<p><strong>A couple of Twitter links</strong></p>

<p>Besides the <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> account, you can also follow a couple of Hudson's more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our benevolent dictator, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/bshine">Ben Shine</a> from Yahoo! who's been working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there's <a href="http://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Ferguson Smart</a> who's been working on a <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book">Hudson book</a>. Of course I've tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible in the <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/contributors">@contributors Twitter list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hacking Hudson</strong></p>

<p>When starting to hack Hudson, it's useful to start by understanding <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Building+Hudson">how to build Hudson</a>. If hacking Hudson's core isn't your cup of tea, you can always start with the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugin+tutorial">plugin tutorial</a> and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you're hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/">online Javadocs for Hudson</a></p>

<p><strong>Communicate</strong>
The two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing%20List">mailing lists</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">IRC channel</a>. During "regular business hours" for the pacific standard time zone, you can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your queries.</p>

<p>I'd list more, but I'm too busy reading about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/exclusive-google-to-go-nuclear/">Google's nuclear weapons program</a>. ;)
