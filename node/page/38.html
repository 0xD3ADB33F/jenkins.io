So you've found a vulnerability, now what?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Hudson, like all web applications, is not immune from vulnerabilities that could open up attack vectors for malicious use. What puts Hudson in a league of its own compared to others is its ability to execute arbitrary commands on slave machines, or in the case of the EC2 plugin, execute arbitrary commands "in the cloud." In light of all this, Hudson is quite secure and offers a variety of mechanisms to reduce the potential for exploits. <img src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/hacker-hat.jpg" width="150" align="right" /></p>

<p>Despite Hudson's security track record, you've managed to find a vulnerability in Hudson, and decide to don your white hat and inform the Hudson team. First off, let me commend you on your brilliant decision to report the vulnerability, you are truly a leader among men.</p>

<p>Generally immediate public disclosure of vulnerabilities is frowned upon as it doesn't give us much time to react, investigate and patch the hole. For this reason there is the "<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/SECURITY">SECURITY</a>" project in Hudson's JIRA. The SECURITY project is a more locked down section of JIRA than the other projects and allows you to submit issues and have them reviewed by the Hudson core developers who can assess the vulnerability. When reporting the issue, it will be helpful to include information regarding the environment the Hudson instance is running in (such as the servlet container) as well as any pertinent reproduction steps so the team can reproduce, fix and verify with as little wheel-spinning as possible.</p>

<p>What happens next wholly determines on the severity of the issue, if it's a highly critical vulnerability, the team will likely make an out-of-schedule release and advise users to upgrade. If it's a less critical hole, the fix will be included in an upcoming scheduled release. Either way, the Hudson team has a good track record of correct potential security holes in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>After the hole you've discovered has been patched and released, you can revel in the fact that you helped make Hudson better, thanks!</p>

11th International Free Software Forum in Brazil
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Last week, friend-of-Hudson <a href="http://leandron.wordpress.com/">Leandro Nunes</a> sent the following message to the <code>users</code> <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/mailing-lists">mailing list</a> regarding his upcoming talk on continuous integration and Hudson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next month I will present <a href="http://verdi.softwarelivre.org/papers_ng/activity/view?activity_id=44">a talk about Hudson</a> in the 11th
International Free Software Forum (<a href="http://softwarelivre.org/fisl11">FISL 11</a>), held in Porto Alegre
Brazil (detailed time and date of the talk are not yet scheduled so).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FISL 11 is one of the biggest free software events in Latin America and will quite literally attract <em>thousands</em> of free software users, hackers, and enthusiasts. It will be held from the 21st to the 24th of July in Porto Alegre, if you're in Central or South America, you should <em>definitely</em> try to attend.</p>

<p>Leandro will have Hudson stickers on hand to give out and will surely do a fantastic job presenting Hudson to all those future Hudson users, I hope you can make it!</p>

Digg Technical Talk

<div class='content'>
<p>Recently our fearless leader, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, was invited by the nice folks over at Digg to give a <a href="http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-technical-talks-kohsuke-kawaguchi">tech talk about continuous integration</a> and automated testing. The Digg engineering team is full of believers in continuous integration, including our very own Andrew Bayer (<code>abayer</code>). Being big users of the <a id="aptureLink_mtfp40hfVE" href="http://twitter.com/saucelabs">Sauce Labs</a> service to drive their vast Selenium test suite, the house was packed with Selenium hackers/users and Hudson users, the stage was set for Kohsuke to give a great presentation.</p>

Stickers starting to arrive
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Way back in March, I asked you all: <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/want-some-hudson-stickers">Want some Hudson stickers?</a></p>

<p>Turns out, a <strong>lot</strong> of you do! Thanks to a huge amuont of help by <a href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/erinandtylerswedding.com/images/gallery/mq/img-9.jpg">my future wife </a>, the <em>first</em> shipment of Hudson stickers went into the mail last week. <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2743/4425921960_a056d816f1_m.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /> This first shipment was only to United States addresses! If you live outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I've not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out international shipments later this week and early next week.
<!--break-->
To those of you that have received your stickers, I'd like to remind you of the terms of our agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conferences</strong>: The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).</li>
  <li><strong>Companies</strong>: I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!</li>
  <li><strong>Nice People</strong>: If you're just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I'll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to  Flickr (tagged: "hudsonstickers")</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/decriptor/status/16737013469" id="aptureLink_YCzhbwFB5t" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; display: block; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 6px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 6px; "><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; " src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/355x210_TwitterArticle/" width="355px" height="210px" title="Tweet by Stephen Shaw" /></a></p>

<p>To be honest, I <em>really</em> just want to see some pictures of Hudson stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks, stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.</p>

<p><strong>If you did not request stickers, but want some now:</strong> please refer to the <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/want-some-hudson-stickers">original post</a> for directions. I do still have stickers left, but there are some "bulk requests" I've not yet filled. I will do my best to send out as many stickers as I can.</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/06/22/hudson-1-363-released/'>
Hudson 1.363 Released!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="/sites/default/files/images/Hudson_coatofarms.gif" align="left" hspace="6" /> Last Friday the Hudson team released release <strong>1.363</strong> which is yet another mixed bag of enhancements and bug fixes. Along with the usual bunch of fixes, this release includes a number of localization updates courtesy of a team of Hudson community volunteers participating in the Hudson <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Internationalization">Internationalization project</a>.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that this post is being published on Tuesday, contrary to the schedule that I operated on with Continuous Blog, I will no longer be posting release updates on Monday morning. Traditionally Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence in the reliability of the update. (<em>Note</em>: This may change in the future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)</p>

<p>If you're a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice that this change log looks eerily similar to the <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-1362-released">1.362 announcement</a> from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from 1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I've since updated the post regarding 1.362's change log.</p>

<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fix queue handling to close locking gap between removing job from queue and starting build,
    to prevent unintended concurrent builds (refactor of change first made in 1.360).
    (<a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Patch-to-fix-concurrent-build-problem-td2229136.html">report</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Allow multiple dependencies between same two projects, as they may trigger under
    different conditions and with different parameters.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5708">issue 5708</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Timeline on build trend page should use server timezone instead of always GMT.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6692">issue 6692</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Don't mask the cause of the checkout related exception.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    "who am I?" page should be visible to everyone.
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Reinstall a JDK when a different version is selected.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5551">issue 5551</a>)
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<h4 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Avoid pointless and harmful redirection when downloading slave.jar. 
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5752">issue 5752</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Cache downloaded JDKs.
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Integrated community-contributed translations (Germany, Greek, Spanish, Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, French,
    Russian, Slovenian, Dutch, Traditional Chinese, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Portuguese.) 
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Upgraded bundled Ant to version 1.8.1.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6562">issue 6562</a>)

  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    File parameters can now be downloaded from the build Parameters page.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6719">issue 6719</a>)

Casual Fridays: Directing traffic with Hudson

<div class='content'>
<p>Intrepid Hudson user Christian Pelster posted a little project of his this week to the "users" <a href="/content/mailing-lists">mailing list</a> called: <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/hudsontrafficlights/">hudsontrafficlights</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Christian describes the project as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Java based daemon aggregates the status of one or more jobs from a Hudson continous integration server into a single status (red, yellow, green) and invokes a shell script on status change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use hudsontrafficlights to control a USB traffic light (such as this <a href="http://www.cleware.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;products_id=118&amp;language=en">USB Traffic Light</a> from Cleware, GmbH) to give you and your colleagues nearly instant feedback on jobs in Hudson, without ever needing to leave your text editor!</p>
