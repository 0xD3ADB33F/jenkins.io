Experimental Plugins Update Center

<p><br/>
Lately there has been several cases where <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/2-version-control-plugins-beta-testing-major-release">we wanted to deliver beta versions of the new plugins</a> to interested users.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To simplify this, we have created a new "experimental" update center, where alpha and beta releases of plugins will be available. Users who are interested in downloading them can go to "Plugin Manager", then to the "advanced" tab, and type in <tt>http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/experimental/update-center.json</tt> in the update center URL field.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When you are looking for the "available" tab, plugins that are experimental are marked accordingly to help you decide which ones to install. Once you install the beta plugins that you wanted, you can switch back to the default <tt>http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/update-center.json<tt> update center.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are developing plugins and you want to distribute experimental plugins, all you have to do is to put "alpha" or "beta" in the version number of <tt>pom.xml</tt>. The backend infrastructure takes care of the rest.<br/>

Behind the Scenes of the Jenkins User Conference Palo Alto!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
The Jenkins User Conference (JUC) Palo Alto is less than two months away! <br/>
The organizing committee, 13 sponsors and 16 speakers have been hard at work coordinating a fun and educational day for the Jenkins community on October 23. Check out the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">agenda</a> and see for yourself! Speakers are traveling from around the globe to take part in this conference, including a number of usual suspects. Dedicated Jenkins experts are coming in from London, Israel, Estonia, Sweden, Taiwan, Boston,  Seattle, Texas and, of course, the local Bay Area. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
New this year, we’ll live stream an entire track, courtesy of our Silver sponsor, <a href="http://confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In keeping with tradition, every year we create a one-of-a-kind Jenkins t-shirt for JUC attendees. This year we are sticking with the ever-popular landmark of Palo Alto, Stanford University. And we are going bright…hope you like (Jenkins) red!<br/>
<br/>

</a></div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are always on the look out for unique and creative ideas for Jenkins t-shirt designs. If you have a cool design in mind please send it to <tt>events@lists.jenkins-ci.org</tt>. You may just see the Jenkins community wearing your design at next year’s conference.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Also check out the great Jenkins collectible that <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a>, the Platinum sponsor, is giving out at the CloudBees table (I heard he looks even better in person).  Quantity is limited so be sure to pick one up at the CloudBees table. You might have to sing, dance, bark or just complete a survey in exchange for the Jenkins bobble head.  Most importantly, don’t forget to have Kohsuke sign it to make it official.<br/>

Loader.io plugin developer interview
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
This is a guest post by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikerowan">Mike Rowan</a>, VP R&amp;D at SendGrid.<br/>
<br/>
<hr><br/>
<div style="float:right; margin:1em"><br/>
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/loaderio.png" width="150" height=150><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<b>Q: Tell us a bit about what your service and plugin do. Who is it for? What are the highlights of your plugin?</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: <a href="http://loader.io">Loader.io</a> is a simple-to-use cloud-based load testing service.  The service is designed for developers and people who need to ensure applications are performing as they should.  It allows developers to perform large-scale load tests on demand, which lets them understand the scalability and performance of their applications.  We realize Jenkins is the preferred build service for a lot of our users, and we know providing a way for them to implement, measure and improve application performance during the continuous build cycle is important. So we wrote a Jenkins plugin that allows load testing to be brought into the continuous build and deployment process with ease.<br/>
<br/>
<p><b><br/>
Q: Did you have to convince your boss/lawyers to open-source your plugin? What was the pitch?</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: No, at SendGrid our focus is always to help make developers’ lives easier, and when we can, we like to  provide tools that they can hack on. Since the Jenkins platform is itself an open source project, following the same model to provide our plugin made perfect sense.  In addition, we encourage others to build on our work, help improve it and ultimately make it better for everyone using it.<br/>
<br/>
<p><b><br/>
Q: How did you learn how to write a plugin?<br/>
</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: We use the Jenkins platform ourselves, and we leverage a number of the plugins available. Having access to these and the Jenkins documentation gave us a great head start. It was an easy decision to write the Jenkins plugin for loader.io, and the Jenkins community provided both detailed instructions as well as support when we needed it.  <br/>
<br/>
<p><b><br/>
Q: Any gotchas in the experience of developing a plugin that you want to share?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: The overall process of developing the plugin was straightforward and simple, but we did run into some scope creep in the middle of the dev process. We found that since the platform was so easy to write for, it made us keep adding more and more features.  Usually this is good, but in the case of our project, we wanted to provide the most value as quickly as possible.  So we scaled back, focused on solid execution for the most important features, and are already preparing to launch a new version with the things we reserved for post v1 availability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b><br/>
Q: What is the reaction from users so far?<br/>
</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: The users we’ve spoken with love the plugin. In addition we’ve already gotten great feedback from some community members on “nice to have’s” in the plugin, some of which we’re already working on.<br/>
<br/>
<p><b><br/>
Q: What tips do you share to those who are interested in writing plugins?<br/>
</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
A: If you have a service that provides value in the build, deployment and post deployment process, then you should be writing a Jenkins plugin.  Two things are  important for anyone writing a plugin: 1) be sure the plugin you’re writing is going to provide true value (if you need it yourself this is a good sign), and 2) make sure you understand the scope of the project and deliver core features and value first, then focus on some extra things.  Providing a valuable plugin sooner than later will help you identify all the right additional features to include, especially when collecting live community feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Some of the things we focused on early in the process were to identify the core features, and more importantly to make it very easy for users of Jenkins to install, use and interpret the loader.io plugin and results.  We wanted to allow users to leverage our plugin for multiple environments and builds with system and global credentials. To do this, we decided to make use of the Credentials plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin), which is a heavily-adopted plugin that provides a standardized API for plugins to store and retrieve credentials.  This plugin allows our users to add and use different credentials in one single Jenkins environment.  In addition, we created a new re-run feature which, when used with continuous build and testing, provides a deep view into the performance of an application over time. Finally, we wanted to bring the same UI experience users have in our environment into Jenkins, which we did by preserving the load test report model and making it function the same in the Jenkins UI. Doing this makes it easy for users to have consistency between the UIs and more easily understand the results regardless of where they’re viewing them.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It’s very easy to write a Jenkins plugin - I hope these insights will encourage you to write your own. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
ps - We’d love your feedback too. Check out our newly-released <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/loaderio">Jenkins plugin</a> for loader.io and let us know what you think.

Extreme Feedback Lamp, Switch Gear style

<p><br/>
This is a guest post by <a href="https://twitter.com/dvaske">Aske Olsson</a><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Extreme feedback is an incredibly powerful way to drive quality and accelerate your developer fast feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Having eXtreme Feedback Devices (XFDs) hooked up to your Jenkins jobs gives everyone on your team instant insight into the current software state. At customer after customer we've seen extreme feedback devices drive significant incremental productivity gains, so about a year ago we started talking about taking the concept mainstream and making it easily available to any development team. So, as a small side-project, we've decided to scratch our own itch and developed an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based, laser-cut, extreme feedback device, specifically designed for Jenkins. It infers a feeling of urgency when the build is broken, and a better sense of a achievement once the problem is fixed. Just connect the XFD to your network, install the "extreme feedback plugin" on your Jenkins server and configure which jobs to feedback extremely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
At the Jenkins Code Camp in Copenhagen today (with Kohsuke) we've made the lamp speak the name of the developer who broke the build :), improved the plugin's UI in Jenkins, and gotten the the lamp's display to list all the developers who contributed to the last change. Of course you can contribute too, just fork the repositories at <a href="https://github.com/switchgears/extremefeedbacklamp">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/switchgears/extreme-feedback-plugin">here</a> and create a pull request.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you're interested in trying out extreme feedback in your own team you can order <a href="http://www.gitgear.com/xfd">your own XFD lamp</a><br/>

Git plugin 2.0 contains a major refactoring and UI simplifications, and TFS plugin contains a rewritten polling logic that does not require a workspace.<br/>

Jenkins User Conference is back to California again!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Just like the last two years, this full day event packs talks from Jenkins developers and users, and it would be a great opportunity for Jenkins users to get to know each other and share their experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">The agenda is already posted</a>, covering everything from robotics to mobile developments, effective management of Jenkins instances to branching techniques. I'm personally looking forward to a number of talks from serious large-scale users, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">JUC Israel</a> was of any indication, it'd be a great opportunity to get feedback from people.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, we are moving the event to a weekday (Oct 23rd) to see if it helps or hurts the attendance. Similarly, the event is now in Palo Alto, as opposed to San Francisco. The site also happens to be a former Sun Microsystems headquarter, a place of some nostalgic value to me.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I am also very happy to see a number of active community members <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">signing up their employers to sponsor the event</a>. These will help us manage the cost of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So really, all that's needed is YOU! <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955">Please register for the event</a> (I believe the early bird price stays until this Friday), and looking forward to seeing you.
