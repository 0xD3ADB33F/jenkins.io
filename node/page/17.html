<p><br/>
Today on IRC, I was asked how someone new to the project can get started working on Jenkins, when s/he has no particular preference or pet-peeve.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This is a good question for which the project should have a canned answer ready, so here is one approach &mdash; adopt a plugin!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Often, a Jenkins plugin gets developed by someone to scratch his own itch. That person shares the plugin with the community, and since it does everything he needs, he moves on to work on something else. Then another person starts using that plugin, comes up with an idea for improvement, implements that, and then moves on. Given that we have more than 900 plugins today, there are a plenty of plugins that are currently co-maintained by the community, which could really use a focused loving caregiver.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So why don't you adopt a plugin? You can pick up one of those plugins and act as a maintainer. You'll hear appreciation from people who are using that plugin, and most plugins are small and simple enough even for people new to Jenkins. Above all, working on plugins don't require much communication with existing developers and implicit processes, which is often difficult for new people to find out.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Here's how you can find a plugin to adopt. You can look at <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests">repositories that have most pending pull requests</a>. Plugins with lots of pull requests likely could use some help, so check if anyone is actively working on it and talk to him, or if you don't see much activities from a single person, just go ahead and adopt the plugin.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html">Usage statistics</a> has <tt>top-plugins500.svg</tt> (this is for <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/201404-top-plugins500.svg">the last month</a>). Open that in Firefox, which lets you zoom in. Scroll all the way to the right, and you see popular plugins. Compare that with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/">our GitHub repositories</a>, and you can find popular plugins that aren't getting enough love.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">Issue tracker</a> is also a good place to look for a plugin in need of help. Every plugin has a separate component, so look at bugs and RFEs filed against those, especially with lots of votes. Fix a bug is great, but even just helping with the triage process would be highly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Try adopting a plugin for a while, and when you get the hang of it, let <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">the dev list know</a>. Update <tt>pom.xml</tt> to have your name listed as a maintainer. Come <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">join IRC</a>. That way, we know who you are and how to reach you.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
See, it's really not that hard. And there's something really satisfying in making things a little better and seeing happy users. Anyway, looking forward to working with you!

Over the past 30 days or so, <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/">the acceptance test project</a> has made a great progress.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This project consists of a reusable harness that can be used by plugin developers and users to write functional test cases. These tests can be run against Jenkins instances that are deployed in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/CONTROLLER.md">all sorts of different ways</a>, and can interact with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/FIXTURES.md">complex real fixtures</a>. These tests can be also run with specific version of Jenkins core and a combination of plugins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The number of tests have <a href="https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/core/job/acceptance-test-harness/">steadily increased to above 300</a>. Several of those are by <a href="https://github.com/eidottermihi">Michael Prankl</a>, where he tests <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/src/test/java/plugins/LdapPluginTest.java">the LDAP plugin with the real OpenLDAP server instance</a> that runs inside Docker &mdash; a kind of test that just wasn't possible before can be now easily written.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/graphs/contributors">More than a dozen people</a> have contributed. <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/commits/master">A dozen changes are going in every single day</a>, and more are coming &mdash; for example, Stephen is working on modularizing this harness and adding new pieces that allow people to do scalability and load testing. That'll be a part of this effort soon.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are one of the large scale users who are interested in automating some of your Jenkins acceptance testing, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">drop us a note at the DEV list</a> so that we can work together. You can also watch the recording of our last <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">office hours</a> where I demoed how you'd develop a test on top of this:<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZHAiywgMG-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
<br/>

I think we all agree that this is an important effort/ Looking forward to joining the efforts with more people in the community!<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
This week I'm going to do an office hour on how to write an acceptance test in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness">Jenkins acceptance test harness</a>. The event is on <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140519T11&p1=283&ah=1">Wednesday 11am PT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This new Selenium-based test harness is full of page objects and other abstractions that let you write blackbox integration tests on Jenkins and its plugins, as well as how they behave under various environments. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Unlike our regular office hours, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cpr7lhq3d544rj5uqid4rin3deg">the event is done through Hangout on air</a>. But I do want at least several people to join Hangout interactively, not just watch the event in a read-only mode.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To join the event interactively (as opposed to read-only), I think you need to <a href="https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYeeXozAE_RiZWtTfX-O-sEtxJ3qhu4Asnfy7tZOZf3hs3jX1Q">come here</a> (but since Hangout URL can change, please check back on this post right before the office hour begins, so that I can post an up-to-date URL.)<br/>

As the Jenkins project grows, <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-infra-team">the need for our infrastructure has been growing</a>. <a href="https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/">Our Jenkins-on-Jenkins</a> needs more build slaves, we need more servers to run our infrastructure services.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And it was <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/big-thanks-rackspace">once again</a> Rackspace who stepped up to the plate; they have kindly donated us more <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">cloud servers</a>. I also use Rackspace for one of my personal servers, and when I went back to their admin console this time, I noticed that they've added <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">a lot more services</a> to their offering.<br/>

Agenda is posted for Jenkins User Conference <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">Boston</a> and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">Berlin</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For Boston, my favorite would be the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JesseGlick">workflow in Jenkins</a> talk that will cover the new workflow job type Jesse and I are working on. As of this writing it is still very much a work in progress, but that talk is our way of putting a stake on the ground that we WILL have something we can talk about by then. There's also some talks that describes how they've put together pieces (including Jenkins) to create a broad automation, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#HoiTsang">Distributed Scrum Development with Jenkins, Vagrant, Fabric and Selenium</a> and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JimCrossley">Moving Existing Enterprise Systems to Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For Berlin, it turns out that we have steller line up of the speakers far beyond my expectation. You have a number of key community contributors/developers like <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#ChristopherOrr">Christopher Orr</a> talking about <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#ChristopherOrr">how he does mobile build/test/deploy</a>, or <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#VincentLatombe">Vincent</a> talking about <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin">literate plugin</a>. I'm also looking forward to the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JulienPivotto">Puppetizing Jenkins Pipelines</a> from Julien Pivotto, which (if I understand correctly) is about deploying Jenkins and its jobs through Puppet &mdash; That is something I notice many people are very interested in nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
All of them are looking forward to meeting you and hearing your thoughts and feedbacks, and I'm sure this is going to be a great learning/networking oppotunities.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-boston-ma-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213">Registration for Boston is here</a>, and <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-berlin-germany-june-25-2014-tickets-10557974185">registration for Berlin is here</a>.

We are looking for volunteers to join the small infra team here at the Jenkins project. We are the butlers of the butler that get Mr.Jenkins going.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We've been <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-puppet">managing our servers through puppet</a>, and have been slowly folding pieces one at a time to puppet, but there's still a lot of snowflake services that need proper operationalization.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So to fix them up, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">PuppetLabs</a> folks generously agreed to help us get going with a deployment of Puppet Enterprise. Tyler has managed to arrange a "rapid deployment" engagement. To kick start the effort, an instructor would come for one week (April 28th-May 2nd) to bring us up to speed on modern Puppet. we'll then spend some time on our own to puppt-ize more, and deploy Puppet Enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The end goal is to ensure sustainability of our infrastructure, in case of unexpected server loss.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As we are about to get this effort going, we think this is a good time to solicit a few more volunteers. We are looking for someone who could join this two week engagement in San Francisco, and keep their involvement beyond that. This is a part time volunteer work, and you'd get some visibility and exposure to the inner guts of open-source projects, not to mention the satisfaction of getting thanked for your work.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are interested, please <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists">drop us a note at the infra list</a>.<br/>

One of the few plugins that I still personally maintain is <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Directory+plugin">Active Directory plugin</a>. In the past few months, I've been making steady improvements in this plugin, thanks to various inputs and bug reports given to me from the ClodBees customers.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the recent fixes was to get <a href="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9258">the "remember me" feature</a> finally working for Active Directory. This requires a relatively new Jenkins 1.556, but it eliminates the need to having to constantly type the password in. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Then I've rebumped the version of <a href="http://github.com/kohsuke/com4j">COM4J</a>, which was <a href="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16429">causing a thread leak</a> when Jenkins runs on Windows. If you are running a Windows deployment with lots of active users, this probably would have contributed to the instability of Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And then lastly, a small but crucial improvement was made to the way we search group membership, so that we can avoid recursively searching AD. This should result in a significant speed improvement when you are logging into Jenkins through AD.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The latest version of the plugin as of writing is 1.37. I hope you'll have a chance to update the plugin soon.<br/>

One of the new efforts in Jenkins this year is <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness">the acceptance test harness</a> for Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We will be doing the Jenkins office hours next week to go over this and sync up and coordinate between people in the community that are trying to work on this. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It'll be <b>April 23rd 11am PT</b> (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Governance+Meeting&iso=20140423T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1">see what this time is in your time zone</a>) on Google Hangout at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/hangout">http://jenkins-ci.org/hangout</a>. If you are intereste in hacking Jenkins or if you are a large user of Jenkins who have acceptance tests, we are looking forward to seeing you there.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For those of you who haven't looked, this test harness allows you to write blackbox tests of Jenkins and its plugins. It was originally used to test LTS releases, but over the time, it acquired a number of features, such as ...:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Docker support for launching complex fixtures to test Jenkins with.<br/>
<li>Pluggability to launch Jenkins under test (JUT) in many different environments<br/>
<li>Pluggability to provision Jenkins and slaves from EC2 to test large deployments<br/>
<li>Choice of cucumber or JUnit to write test scripts<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are working on porting over existing test cases, but we'd like to work with users to move their acceptance tests on top of this same harness. The idea is to pool those test cases in the community so that we can test Jenkins and its plugins as we develop them. For this to work, we want tests to have lots of metadata (such as what plugins it touches), and for the harness to have sufficient modularity that different people can run the same scenario against different deployments, including existing instance.<br/>
