Two Weeks Till Jenkins User Conference Berlin
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
Following right on the heels of our <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">US-East Jenkins User Conference in Boston</a>, we have JUC Europe in Berlin on June 25. Like the East Coast conference, the Berlin one is almost full, so <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-europe-berlin-june-25-2014-tickets-10557974185">sign up while you can.</a><br/>
<br/>
Our venue in Berlin is <a href="http://www.kosmos-berlin.de/en/home.html">KOSMOS</a>, a building with <a href="http://www.kosmos-berlin.de/en/history.html">a fascinating history</a>. The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings. <br/>
<br/>
We have <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">an excellent line-up of speakers</a> filling up two conference tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/JUC-Berlin-Sponsors.png" /> <br/>
<br/>
This year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).<br/>
<br/>
We are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.<br/>
<br/>
PS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/berlin">CD Summit on June 24</a> at the same venue. There’s also <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/nyc">one on June 19 in NYC</a>. The summit will focus on how continuous integration with Jenkins streamlines processes and automates testing and deployment, providing the foundation you need for continuous delivery.

One of the current efforts under way in the dev list is driven by <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a> et al, who is working on introducing a series of small ball improvements to the user interface in Jenkins. If this is something you are interested in (and who aren't?), you should see <a href="https://gist.github.com/kevinburke/9d4f127a7005eaa9d970">Kevin Burke's manifest</a> that sets out the plan of attack, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/zDaX4yiWLLw">This mega thread on the dev list</a> for the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
There are numerous sub-conversations born out of this, and one of them is the minimum required servlet spec version for Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins devs are thinking about ways to update page contents post load, for example so that the list view will keep updating as stuff happens. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websocket">WebSocket</a> was discussed as an option, and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">server-side events</a>, which seems to be the current favorite.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To use any of those async HTTP features, we need servlet 3.0. Unfortunately, if we are to do it, Jenkins will not run on earlier versions of the container. There's no graceful fallback that works with servlet 2.5 containers due to the way servlet 3.0 is written.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So I looked into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14YzFgKBB6BvbRU_1OjChC3efECWPs77TEGTU09t3KGw/edit#gid=873989456">the impact of this change to the users</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that the most users run Jenkins through <tt>java -jar jenkins.war</tt>, which are already running servlet 3.0 compatible Winstone 2.x (based on Jetty 8.) And people running newer version of Jenkins tends to run newer version of containers. When I look at people who are running >=1.509 and later, 70% of them run on servlet 3 compatible container. The number for >=1.532 is 84%, then for >=1.554 it's 94%.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When I look at which container is dragging us down as of >= 1.554, you see that there's a sizable Tomcat6 deployments (2.5%). If we start requiring Servlet 3.0 these people will be in a nasty surprise. Then there's about 1.8% who claims to be running on Winstone 0.9.10, which is really puzzling, but I'm assuming these people are getting OEM-ed Jenkins of a sort (multiple large companies are known to do this), so these people will likely be able to update to Winstone 2.x automatically by virtue of getting a new jenkins.war from their upstream. So all in all I'd say if we start requiring servlet 3.0 today, there'll be about 3% user base who will be impacted.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This post is a trial balloon to see the community reaction to this idea. If you have reasons to argue against us moving to servlet 3.0, we'd like to hear from you &mdash; <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23378">please share your thoughts on our issue tracker</a>!<br/>

If you will be on the US East Coast or in Berlin for JUC, some of the JUC sponsors are organizing separate events called <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit">Continuous Delivery Seminar</a>, which might be of interest to you. These events focus more on higher-level business value questions as well as vendor solutions that are difficult in community-focused JUC.<br/>
<br/>

<p><br/>
Let me start by introducing myself, my name is Steven Christou. Many of you might know me on IRC as schristou, my github id as <a href="https://github.com/christ66">christ66</a>, or my twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/schristou88">@schristou88</a>. In Jenkins, I am currently working on some significant improvements to the subversion-plugin, along with various random bug fixes. I am also the current maintainer of <a href="http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura">Cobertura</a>, an open source code coverage tool for java. Prior to working on Jenkins, I was working on Hudson at the Eclipse Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While working on Jenkins, I usually get requests (usually in IRC) about where to start when writing a plugin. Some examples are "Where do I start?" or "Do you have any examples?". Well at <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">JUC Boston</a>, I will be hosting a small lecture called Get Drunk on the Code! I will be giving the lecture in the rooms "Back Bay" (1 & 2) where people will be able to sit down, drink a beer, and learn how to write a Jenkins plugin! I will be teaching people everything from how to get started, to some advanced techniques like writing a new <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI">CLI Command</a>, and writing your own builder. I forgot to mention that I will be handing out beer while this is happening!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This session will be happening after the exhibit break from 3:30pm to 6:00pm. It will be two hours where I will be walking around, and helping users if they encounter any issues while the session is happening. So grab your laptop, a beer and get drunk on the code! Don't get too drunk, but if you do at least you can improve the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beer+Plugin">beer plugin</a>!"

Only a few weeks until <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">our Jenkins User Conference US East</a> kicks off in Boston on June 18. Right now more than 300 people have registered and we’ve had to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-us-east-boston-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213">release more tickets</a>! If you will be anywhere near New England on June 18, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-us-east-boston-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213">sign up fast so you don’t miss the fun</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
This year marks the butler’s first conference tour to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>. He has chosen <a href="http://www.seaportboston.com/">the fabulous Seaport hotel</a> on the waterfront for a venue &mdash; a hotel that's far better than what I usually stay in :-). You can even take a water taxi to <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boston">see the sites</a> or get to and from the airport. For airport transfers, you can also just hop on <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER">the silver line bus</a> and arrive across the street from the hotel (the stop is called "<a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=25092&lat=42.349098&lng=-71.04206">World Trade Center Station</a>".)<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year we have <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">an incredible line-up of speakers</a>. Attendees will be well fed, caffeinated, and even pickled if they choose... the afternoon break will feature BEvERages. And everyone gets this year’s Jenkins World Tour t-shirt.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Nothing about conference-throwing is cheap, so we’d like to take a moment to thank our generous JUC US East sponsors. It speaks so well for the JUC community that so many companies have stepped up to support Jenkins and produce a first-class conference. So here is the shout-out for them:<br/>

<p><br/>
Today on IRC, I was asked how someone new to the project can get started working on Jenkins, when s/he has no particular preference or pet-peeve.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This is a good question for which the project should have a canned answer ready, so here is one approach &mdash; adopt a plugin!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Often, a Jenkins plugin gets developed by someone to scratch his own itch. That person shares the plugin with the community, and since it does everything he needs, he moves on to work on something else. Then another person starts using that plugin, comes up with an idea for improvement, implements that, and then moves on. Given that we have more than 900 plugins today, there are a plenty of plugins that are currently co-maintained by the community, which could really use a focused loving caregiver.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So why don't you adopt a plugin? You can pick up one of those plugins and act as a maintainer. You'll hear appreciation from people who are using that plugin, and most plugins are small and simple enough even for people new to Jenkins. Above all, working on plugins don't require much communication with existing developers and implicit processes, which is often difficult for new people to find out.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Here's how you can find a plugin to adopt. You can look at <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests">repositories that have most pending pull requests</a>. Plugins with lots of pull requests likely could use some help, so check if anyone is actively working on it and talk to him, or if you don't see much activities from a single person, just go ahead and adopt the plugin.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html">Usage statistics</a> has <tt>top-plugins500.svg</tt> (this is for <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/201404-top-plugins500.svg">the last month</a>). Open that in Firefox, which lets you zoom in. Scroll all the way to the right, and you see popular plugins. Compare that with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/">our GitHub repositories</a>, and you can find popular plugins that aren't getting enough love.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">Issue tracker</a> is also a good place to look for a plugin in need of help. Every plugin has a separate component, so look at bugs and RFEs filed against those, especially with lots of votes. Fix a bug is great, but even just helping with the triage process would be highly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Try adopting a plugin for a while, and when you get the hang of it, let <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">the dev list know</a>. Update <tt>pom.xml</tt> to have your name listed as a maintainer. Come <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">join IRC</a>. That way, we know who you are and how to reach you.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
See, it's really not that hard. And there's something really satisfying in making things a little better and seeing happy users. Anyway, looking forward to working with you!

Acceptance test project progress report
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Over the past 30 days or so, <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/">the acceptance test project</a> has made a great progress.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This project consists of a reusable harness that can be used by plugin developers and users to write functional test cases. These tests can be run against Jenkins instances that are deployed in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/CONTROLLER.md">all sorts of different ways</a>, and can interact with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/FIXTURES.md">complex real fixtures</a>. These tests can be also run with specific version of Jenkins core and a combination of plugins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The number of tests have <a href="https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/core/job/acceptance-test-harness/">steadily increased to above 300</a>. Several of those are by <a href="https://github.com/eidottermihi">Michael Prankl</a>, where he tests <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/src/test/java/plugins/LdapPluginTest.java">the LDAP plugin with the real OpenLDAP server instance</a> that runs inside Docker &mdash; a kind of test that just wasn't possible before can be now easily written.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/graphs/contributors">More than a dozen people</a> have contributed. <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/commits/master">A dozen changes are going in every single day</a>, and more are coming &mdash; for example, Stephen is working on modularizing this harness and adding new pieces that allow people to do scalability and load testing. That'll be a part of this effort soon.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are one of the large scale users who are interested in automating some of your Jenkins acceptance testing, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">drop us a note at the DEV list</a> so that we can work together. You can also watch the recording of our last <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">office hours</a> where I demoed how you'd develop a test on top of this:<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZHAiywgMG-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>

I think we all agree that this is an important effort/ Looking forward to joining the efforts with more people in the community!<br/>
