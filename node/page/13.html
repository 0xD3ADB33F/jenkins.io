What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation
virtually any project

<br/>
<p><br/>
Let me start by introducing myself, my name is Steven Christou. Many of you might know me on IRC as schristou, my github id as <a href="https://github.com/christ66">christ66</a>, or my twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/schristou88">@schristou88</a>. In Jenkins, I am currently working on some significant improvements to the subversion-plugin, along with various random bug fixes. I am also the current maintainer of <a href="http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura">Cobertura</a>, an open source code coverage tool for java. Prior to working on Jenkins, I was working on Hudson at the Eclipse Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While working on Jenkins, I usually get requests (usually in IRC) about where to start when writing a plugin. Some examples are "Where do I start?" or "Do you have any examples?". Well at <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">JUC Boston</a>, I will be hosting a small lecture called Get Drunk on the Code! I will be giving the lecture in the rooms "Back Bay" (1 & 2) where people will be able to sit down, drink a beer, and learn how to write a Jenkins plugin! I will be teaching people everything from how to get started, to some advanced techniques like writing a new <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI">CLI Command</a>, and writing your own builder. I forgot to mention that I will be handing out beer while this is happening!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This session will be happening after the exhibit break from 3:30pm to 6:00pm. It will be two hours where I will be walking around, and helping users if they encounter any issues while the session is happening. So grab your laptop, a beer and get drunk on the code! Don't get too drunk, but if you do at least you can improve the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beer+Plugin">beer plugin</a>!"

Jenkins User Conference Boston is around the corner!

<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Only a few weeks until <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">our Jenkins User Conference US East</a> kicks off in Boston on June 18. Right now more than 300 people have registered and we’ve had to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-us-east-boston-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213">release more tickets</a>! If you will be anywhere near New England on June 18, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-us-east-boston-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213">sign up fast so you don’t miss the fun</a>.<br/>

</a></div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year marks the butler’s first conference tour to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>. He has chosen <a href="http://www.seaportboston.com/">the fabulous Seaport hotel</a> on the waterfront for a venue &mdash; a hotel that's far better than what I usually stay in :-). You can even take a water taxi to <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boston">see the sites</a> or get to and from the airport. For airport transfers, you can also just hop on <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER">the silver line bus</a> and arrive across the street from the hotel (the stop is called "<a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=25092&lat=42.349098&lng=-71.04206">World Trade Center Station</a>".)<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year we have <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">an incredible line-up of speakers</a>. Attendees will be well fed, caffeinated, and even pickled if they choose... the afternoon break will feature BEvERages. And everyone gets this year’s Jenkins World Tour t-shirt.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Nothing about conference-throwing is cheap, so we’d like to take a moment to thank our generous JUC US East sponsors. It speaks so well for the JUC community that so many companies have stepped up to support Jenkins and produce a first-class conference. So here is the shout-out for them:<br/>

Adopt a plugin

</div><br/>
<p><br/>
Today on IRC, I was asked how someone new to the project can get started working on Jenkins, when s/he has no particular preference or pet-peeve.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This is a good question for which the project should have a canned answer ready, so here is one approach &mdash; adopt a plugin!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Often, a Jenkins plugin gets developed by someone to scratch his own itch. That person shares the plugin with the community, and since it does everything he needs, he moves on to work on something else. Then another person starts using that plugin, comes up with an idea for improvement, implements that, and then moves on. Given that we have more than 900 plugins today, there are a plenty of plugins that are currently co-maintained by the community, which could really use a focused loving caregiver.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So why don't you adopt a plugin? You can pick up one of those plugins and act as a maintainer. You'll hear appreciation from people who are using that plugin, and most plugins are small and simple enough even for people new to Jenkins. Above all, working on plugins don't require much communication with existing developers and implicit processes, which is often difficult for new people to find out.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Here's how you can find a plugin to adopt. You can look at <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pending+Pull+Requests">repositories that have most pending pull requests</a>. Plugins with lots of pull requests likely could use some help, so check if anyone is actively working on it and talk to him, or if you don't see much activities from a single person, just go ahead and adopt the plugin.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html">Usage statistics</a> has <tt>top-plugins500.svg</tt> (this is for <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/201404-top-plugins500.svg">the last month</a>). Open that in Firefox, which lets you zoom in. Scroll all the way to the right, and you see popular plugins. Compare that with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/">our GitHub repositories</a>, and you can find popular plugins that aren't getting enough love.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">Issue tracker</a> is also a good place to look for a plugin in need of help. Every plugin has a separate component, so look at bugs and RFEs filed against those, especially with lots of votes. Fix a bug is great, but even just helping with the triage process would be highly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Try adopting a plugin for a while, and when you get the hang of it, let <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">the dev list know</a>. Update <tt>pom.xml</tt> to have your name listed as a maintainer. Come <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">join IRC</a>. That way, we know who you are and how to reach you.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
See, it's really not that hard. And there's something really satisfying in making things a little better and seeing happy users. Anyway, looking forward to working with you!

Acceptance test project progress report
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Over the past 30 days or so, <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/">the acceptance test project</a> has made a great progress.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This project consists of a reusable harness that can be used by plugin developers and users to write functional test cases. These tests can be run against Jenkins instances that are deployed in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/CONTROLLER.md">all sorts of different ways</a>, and can interact with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/FIXTURES.md">complex real fixtures</a>. These tests can be also run with specific version of Jenkins core and a combination of plugins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The number of tests have <a href="https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/core/job/acceptance-test-harness/">steadily increased to above 300</a>. Several of those are by <a href="https://github.com/eidottermihi">Michael Prankl</a>, where he tests <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/src/test/java/plugins/LdapPluginTest.java">the LDAP plugin with the real OpenLDAP server instance</a> that runs inside Docker &mdash; a kind of test that just wasn't possible before can be now easily written.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/graphs/contributors">More than a dozen people</a> have contributed. <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/commits/master">A dozen changes are going in every single day</a>, and more are coming &mdash; for example, Stephen is working on modularizing this harness and adding new pieces that allow people to do scalability and load testing. That'll be a part of this effort soon.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are one of the large scale users who are interested in automating some of your Jenkins acceptance testing, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">drop us a note at the DEV list</a> so that we can work together. You can also watch the recording of our last <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">office hours</a> where I demoed how you'd develop a test on top of this:<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZHAiywgMG-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
<br/>

I think we all agree that this is an important effort/ Looking forward to joining the efforts with more people in the community!<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
This week I'm going to do an office hour on how to write an acceptance test in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness">Jenkins acceptance test harness</a>. The event is on <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140519T11&p1=283&ah=1">Wednesday 11am PT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This new Selenium-based test harness is full of page objects and other abstractions that let you write blackbox integration tests on Jenkins and its plugins, as well as how they behave under various environments. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Unlike our regular office hours, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cpr7lhq3d544rj5uqid4rin3deg">the event is done through Hangout on air</a>. But I do want at least several people to join Hangout interactively, not just watch the event in a read-only mode.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To join the event interactively (as opposed to read-only), I think you need to <a href="https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYeeXozAE_RiZWtTfX-O-sEtxJ3qhu4Asnfy7tZOZf3hs3jX1Q">come here</a> (but since Hangout URL can change, please check back on this post right before the office hour begins, so that I can post an up-to-date URL.)<br/>

As the Jenkins project grows, <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-infra-team">the need for our infrastructure has been growing</a>. <a href="https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/">Our Jenkins-on-Jenkins</a> needs more build slaves, we need more servers to run our infrastructure services.<br/>

And it was <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/big-thanks-rackspace">once again</a> Rackspace who stepped up to the plate; they have kindly donated us more <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">cloud servers</a>.

<p><br/>
Agenda is posted for Jenkins User Conference <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">Boston</a> and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">Berlin</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For Boston, my favorite would be the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JesseGlick">workflow in Jenkins</a> talk that will cover the new workflow job type Jesse and I are working on. As of this writing it is still very much a work in progress, but that talk is our way of putting a stake on the ground that we WILL have something we can talk about by then. There's also some talks that describes how they've put together pieces (including Jenkins) to create a broad automation, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#HoiTsang">Distributed Scrum Development with Jenkins, Vagrant, Fabric and Selenium</a> and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JimCrossley">Moving Existing Enterprise Systems to Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For Berlin, it turns out that we have steller line up of the speakers far beyond my expectation. You have a number of key community contributors/developers like <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#ChristopherOrr">Christopher Orr</a> talking about <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#ChristopherOrr">how he does mobile build/test/deploy</a>, or <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#VincentLatombe">Vincent</a> talking about <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin">literate plugin</a>. I'm also looking forward to the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JulienPivotto">Puppetizing Jenkins Pipelines</a> from Julien Pivotto, which (if I understand correctly) is about deploying Jenkins and its jobs through Puppet &mdash; That is something I notice many people are very interested in nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
All of them are looking forward to meeting you and hearing your thoughts and feedbacks, and I'm sure this is going to be a great learning/networking oppotunities.<br/>
