Jenkins User Conference – Save the Date
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have some exciting news to share with you! We have finalized most of the dates and locations for the 2015 Jenkins User Conference (JUC) World Tour.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Save the date(s):</p><br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>US East (Washington DC): June 18-19</li><br/>
<li>Europe (London): June 23-24</li><br/>
<li>Israel: July 16 (ETA)</li><br/>
<li>US West (Santa Clara): September 2-3</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p>The big news? The JUC agenda has been expanded this year to cover two days! That means you get twice as many opportunities to learn how others are using Jenkins and to network with other Jenkins users.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers"><b>CALL FOR PAPERS IS OPEN FOR ALL JUC CONFERENCES</b></a></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We need JUC speakers! <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers"><b>The Call for Papers is open now and you can apply here.</b></a> This is an opportunity for YOU to give back to the community by sharing your Jenkins knowledge and success. Jenkins speakers contribute significantly to the overall JUC experience.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>In return for speaking, you will receive free admission to the conference and fame/fortune within the Jenkins community. OK, we can’t guarantee the latter, but we <i>can</i> guarantee the former! <b>Hurry and apply now, because</b> <b>the Call for Papers deadline for US East and Europe expires on March 22, 2015.</b></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Not interested in speaking? Another way to contribute to the community is by letting us know who you want to hear from. Nominate or refer that amazing speaker and we’ll do the rest. Contact <a href="mailto:alytong13@gmail.com">alytong13@gmail.com</a></p><br/>
<br/>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/2015-juc-and-cd-summit-world-tour-sponsorships"><b>JUC SPONSORSHIPS</b></a></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Lastly, be a JUC sponsor. Any organization can do this – whether a vendor that sells into the Jenkins ecosystem or a company that has received value from Jenkins and wants to give back to the community. <b><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/2015-juc-and-cd-summit-world-tour-sponsorships">You can find out more here.</a> </b>(NOTE: JUC is not a moneymaking venture for the community – so sponsorships do make a difference.)</p>

100K Celebration Podcast
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
As a part of <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26">the Jenkins 100K celebration</a>, Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, R. Tyler Croy, Chris Orr, and myself got together late Tuesday evening to go over the history of the project, how big the community was back then, how we grow, where we are now, and maybe a bit about future.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We got carried away and the recording became longer than we all planned. But it has some nice sound bites, back stage stories, and stuff even some of us didn't know about! I hope you'll enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/podcast/100k.mp3">The MP3 file is here</a>, or you can use your favorite podcast app and subscribe to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/podcast">http://jenkins-ci.org/podcast</a>.<br/>

100K Celebration Podcast Recording
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
In preparation for <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26">Jenkins 100K celebration</a>, I'm going to record a one-time podcast with Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, and R. Tyler Croy.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
My current plan is to go over the history of the project, how big the community was back then, how we grow, where we are now, and maybe a bit about future.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
But if you have any other suggestions/questions that you'd like us to discuss, you have 3 or 4 more hours to send in that suggestion! Your feedback would help us make a better recording, so please don't hesitate to tell us.

Jenkins Celebration Day is February 26
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Congratulations! The Jenkins project officially went over the 100K active users mark sometime in January. As of January 31, <a href="http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg">we were at 102,992</a>. YOU are one of the 100K active users!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As discussed on <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2015/">a couple recent project meetings</a>, we have designated <b>February 26</b> as Jenkins Celebration Day.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To make some noise, here is what we are doing starting NOW:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><br/>
Write a blog about anything related to Jenkins. Post your blog and Tweet out a link to it. Include the hashtag <b>#Jenkins100K</b> in your post.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
On February 26, we will hold a raffle and pick four names at random.  The grand prize winner will get a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-figure-available-shapeways">3D Jenkins Butler model</a>. Five others will get their pick of Jenkins swag (up to $20) from <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/jenkinsci">the Jenkins online store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>OTHER WAYS TO CELEBRATE</h2><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
There are a number of other things planned and we want YOU to be involved. This blog post is the central place to come for all things related to the celebration. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>

<b>Recording – Jenkins Governance Board</b><br/>
Dean, Tyler, Andrew and I will get together this month and record some thoughts about the Jenkins project. We will share that recording with you from this page on February 26.<br/>

<b><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/jenkins-100k-profile_4.jpg">Twitter Badge</a></b><br/>
For those of us on social media that want to proudly celebrate our community, we will have a special badge that you can use for your profile image on Twitter or any of the other social media forums. Feel free to use the badge as long as you want – but let’s get as many of us using it as possible between now and February 27.<br/>
<br/>

<p><br/>
<a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c4eagqodepqojlrv7glhc1ctg48">In tomorrow's Jenkins office hours</a>, Jesse Glick will talk about two topics in the workflow plugin that he has been asked about:<br/>

#BreakingBuilds
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
A lot of us has grown fond of our loyal butler Mr.Jenkins over time, which was created by <a href="http://frontside.io/">Frontside</a> and chosen as <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/category/image-galleries/jenkins-logo-contest">a result of a logo contest</a>. In the true open-source style, the logo has since evolved into many different derivative works, such as <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Emotional+Jenkins+Plugin">a plugin</a>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-figure-available-shapeways">a 3D model</a>, and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/behind-scenes-jenkins-user-conference-palo-alto">a bobble head</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Our friends at CloudBees are running a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BreakingBuilds">#BreakingBuilds</a> social media contest through Jan 5th to have some fun with Mr.Jenkins. <a href="http://ow.ly/FbZDb">Read Sacha Labourey's blog post</a>, where he draws parallels between what a butler does and what continuous delivery can do.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I especially agree with him on this point:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><br/>
I always loved the idea of using a butler to represent what Jenkins is about, as it projects all of the qualities that define continuous delivery: it is built to be proactive, it will help you fix problems before they happen, it orchestrates your entire pipeline to production without you having to worry about the sophisticated underlying sequence of steps and, if things go wrong Jenkins uses his fingerprint database to trace back the source of the issue. Full service. As your right arm, Jenkins is the reliable and trustworthy guy you want on your team!<br/>
</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://ow.ly/FdEBD">Check out the contest rules</a> and participate. Let's raise the visibility of Jenkins and have some fun in the process!<br/>
