<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2013" target="_blank"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/fosdem-2013.png" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Earlier this year we participated in <a href="/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM 2012</a> in Brussels, Belgium. Overall the event was a major success and we're very happy we were able to take part in it!</p>

<p>For FOSDEM 2013, we'll be back in Brussels and participating in a major way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the <strong>2nd</strong> birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems appropriate that project founder <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> will be giving a <strong>keynote session</strong> titled: "<strong><a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/keynote_vibrant_developer_community/">How we made the Jenkins community</a></strong>"</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt from Kohsuke's talk proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.</p>

  <p>There are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I'll discuss how Jenkins project and the community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/keynote_vibrant_developer_community/">Kohsuke's keynote here</a></p>

<hr />

<p>In addition to the keynote, I (<a href="https://github.com/rtyler">R. Tyler Croy</a>), and a number of members of the Jenkins, Cucumber and Selenium communities are hosting the first ever <strong><a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2012-November/001665.html">Testing and Automation devroom</a></strong> at FOSDEM.</p>

<p>If you're interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/4107243">found here</a>, and the proposal submission form can can be <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9LM2lOY1J5VzFiZTZXWUcxRXhqY1E6MQ">found here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>We are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but the FOSDEM committee hasn't yet confirmed whether or not we will have a table.</p>

<p>Regardless, a <strong>lot</strong> of Jenkins community members will be at FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source contributors and users from around the world.</p>

<p>If you're interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins crowd, there's details coming together on <strong><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM">the FOSDEM wiki page</a></strong>.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!

Los Altos Hackathon This Friday

<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
What better way to end the year than to come join a little Jenkins hackathon this Friday afternoon with Kohsuke (the core developer), Max Spring (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkow+Plugin">Jenkow plugin</a>), and hopefully other Jenkins hackers?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We'll do this at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204997319446652334724.0004d13cfa1eb16f65a99&msa=0&ll=37.377281,-122.113874&spn=0.007656,0.00478">CloudBees Los Altos office</a>, starting around Friday 1pm.<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
Our plan is to primarily hack on the Jenkow plugin, but if you have other projects you'd like to hack on, that'd be welcome. Or if you've been interested in getting started on writing a plugin but haven't had a chance to, this is a great time to do this, and when you get stuck the help is right next to you. Or heck, if you just want to drop by and say hello, that's fine, too.<br/>

Office hours next week: metadata plugin

<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">The last Jenkins office hour of the year</a> hosts Robert Sandell and Tomas Westling, who will go over <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Metadata+plugin">newly open-sourced metadata plugin</a> from Sony Mobile Communications (<a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/">more about this story on their website</a>). This team from Sony Mobile has been known for several other popular plugins, including <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger">the Gerrit trigger plugin</a>. And I think this latest batch of plugins will not disappoint!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As I understand, this plugin is a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/label/JENKINS/plugin-library">library plugin</a>, which is primarily meant to be consumed by other plugins. With help of other plugins using this plugin, it can classify jobs and slaves by adding metadata tags to them. This in turn enables more intelligent scheduling, views, access control, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Personally, I'm very interested in integrating <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/iOS+Device+Connector+Plugin">the iOS device connector plugin</a>, so that one could say "run this job on a Mac where iPad2 is connected", etc. The other piece is to integrate this with <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/External+Resource+Dispatcher">the external resource dispatcher</a> so that Jenkins can grant exclusive device access to jobs while they are running so that tests don't end up trying to use the same device.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are a plugin developer, hopefully this gets you excited. See you <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20121219T11&p1=283&ah=1">Dec 19th 11am PST</a>.<br/>

<p><br/>
We are trying to <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160">raise $2000 travel grants</a> for assisting Jenkins contributors to travel, meet, and strengthen their relationships with the other Jenkins contributors. Specifically, we have <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/">SCALE11x</a> in mind, in which there already are a fair amount of Jenkins contributors concentration.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Being an open-source project, Jenkins developers are highly dispersed, yet a lot gets done in the community through human relationships, just like any other organizations. This poses a challenge, because most of the contributors work on Jenkins on their spare times, and so people are on their own to travel to the shows, creating greater divides between those of us in the U.S., Europe, and in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This fundraising is a bit of experiment to see if it's worth the money. The goal is to sponsor two people who don't work on Jenkins full time to travel to those events (and hopefully present talks, although that's subject to the acceptance by conferences.) We'll also report back what came out of them.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you think this is a worthy goal, <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160">please consider donating</a>. If you'd like to donate but not for this cause, please drop us a note so that we can attribute it accordingly.

Sponsor Jenkins bugs with Freedom Sponsors

<p>(This is a guest post by Tony França)</p>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/FS_vertical_logo_colored_512x347.png" width="128" height="87" />
</div>

<p>Hi all, my name is Tony, I'm the creator of (<a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/">FreedomSponsors</a>) and today I want to talk how Jenkins has inspired me to build it.</p>

<p>Before starting, I'd like to thank the Jenkins crew for letting me publish this guest post in their blog.
On top of that, thank you for maintaining Jenkins as well - I'm a big fan and a heavy user. Jenkins potential to make peoples lives easier is really amazing.
You guys are amazing.
And Kohsuke, you're my personal hero :-)</p>

<p>All right, that being said, let's move on with the story.</p>

<p>Most people who like FreedomSponsors probably don't know that Jenkins is sort of the reason it exists in the first place. That's right, if it wasn't for Jenkins I'd probably never had the idea for FS.</p>

<p>This is how it happened.</p>

<p>I was playing with the (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/OpenID+plugin">Jenkins OpenID plugin</a>), and I was having some trouble with it.
After a little research, I found that there was a JIRA bug for it - (<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9216">JENKINS-9216: Make OpenID work with Google Apps accounts</a>).</p>

<p>"Bummer" - I thought - "Maybe I can try to debug it. Oh boy, but I don't know anything about Jenkins code. That would be too… expensive! I bet there are a few people out there that would be willing to even pay a few bucks to the Jenkins crew to prioritize this."</p>

<p>The moment I thought that, a storm of ideas came rushing into my head.
It was like a conversation with myself in my mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Wait a minute… why can't people actually do just that?! They should be able to."</li>
  <li>"Maybe a JIRA plugin could let them…"</li>
  <li>"But what about other projects, ones that don't use JIRA?"</li>
  <li>"Maybe there could be a central place for all those offers. If many people 'sponsor' the same issue, the developer who solve it might get a decent piece of gold - rightfully deserved. That could even free up more of their time to work on the projects they love :-)"</li>
  <li>"The sponsors would pay the developers out of gratitude, and for the sake of keeping their word."</li>
  <li>"This has the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> spirit in it: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"</li>
</ul>

<p>And I kept thinking, and it didn't took very long until I had the whole "sponsoring model" in my head.
I realised that that was one of the best ideas I had in my life. I was very excited and I had to act on it.</p>

<p>I started studying <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> on that same day. I had already learned some Python before and Django had been on my queue for some time. And I'm glad I did it. I've been building JavaEE (Java web) applications for about 8 years now, and, oh boy, Django makes things soooo much easier, and simpler, and faster to code - I'm in love with it… Okay, but I'm missing the point here.</p>

<p>So, I started building "it" alone on my free time. It took me a few days to pick a name for "it".
The "FreedomSponsors" name came very naturally - it rightfully conveys what the platform would do, and the spirit of software freedom that I'd like to encourage.</p>

<p>Seven weeks later it was done. I had already bought the domain and created an account at Amazon AWS.
So I put it up and started bugging everyone about it.
And guess who was the first person I wanted to tell? Kohsuke Kawaguchi :-)
It was just fair. So I sent him this email.</p>

  <p>Hi Kohsuke.
My name is Tony, I'm a Software Architect.
I'm a big fan and a (very) heavy user of Hudson - Jenkins.
It has really been enabling our company to move towards a "continuous delivery"-like development process in the past couple of years.</p>

  <p>So, thank you for that.</p>

  <p>Also, if it wasn't for Jenkins, maybe I would never had the idea to build the FreedomSponsors web site.
That's my personal project - an idea that I had about six weeks ago.</p>

  <p>You see, most of the time I was developing it, I had you in mind.
I have always felt that "Jenkins is so great, that Kohsuke really deserves to get rich for it".</p>

  <p>I just launched FreedomSponsors - a few minutes ago.
It just felt right to come here and tell you about it :-)</p>

  <p>Let's see if I can get you rich now :-).</p>

  <p>Cheers!
Tony Lâmpada</p>

<p>And his reply just made my day</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 5:19 PM, Kohsuke Kawaguchi <kk at="" kohsuke="" dot="" org=""> wrote:</kk></p>

  <p>Congratulations for launching your service.</p>

  <p>I thought about a similar idea long time ago over a lunch with my colleagues, but my hats off to you for actually making it real. I can imagine a lot of obstacles (most of those you already note in FAQ), but if this works out I think it'd be great.</p>

  <p>By the way, I wonder if you have considered open-sourcing this, say under Aflo GPL. With the network effect and being the dominant contributor, it's very difficult for anyone else to run the same code on public internet to compete with you, and it does let other people contribute small changes, and given your audience is open-source developers, I think it sends the right message as well as help you boost your development. It also seeds the ecosystem (of Bugzilla plugin, JIRA plugin, dashboard, etc.), too.</p>

  <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, FS's code was still closed when I launched it. I was worried about competition indeed.
But his arguments were very convincing. Specially when he talked about sending the right message to the Free Software community. I thought about it for while and came to the conclusion that he has absolutely right. It still took me a few weeks until I moved <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org">the code to Github</a>. I'm glad I did it. The feedback loop has been great.</p>

<p>And that was not his only contribution. He also gave us this very useful piece of feeback:
(<a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/12/jira-plugin-to-link-from-tickets-to-freedomsponsors">JIRA plugin to link from tickets to FreedomSponsors</a>)</p>

<p>Indeed, that was a great idea. My friend and associate Arthur is the one who built it.
Kohsuke suggested that I joined the Jenkins crew at the (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">Jenkins Governance meeting</a>) to see if everyone would agree about installing it on Jenkins JIRA. Everyone liked the idea and had no ojections.</p>

<p>I can't say enough how trilled and honored I felt knowing that Jenkins would be the first project to install our plugin. Thank you folks. Thanks Kohsuke. You guys are awesome :-)</p>

<p>Now FreedomSponsors is growing, slowly but steadily. And what makes us really happy is that almost every developer we tell about it just loves the idea. We've received valuable, constructive feedback from a lot of people who want to see us moving forward. That's the best incentive that I could wish for.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. The biggest and closest one in the horizon is to start a "movement" that will help spread within companies a culture of contributing more to the free software projects they depend on, by making they realise that that's what's best for everyone. If we can achieve that then we'll have made the free software world even better.</p>

<p>So, everything I wrote so far is, hopefully, only the begginning of this story. And I'm really excited and looking forward to see it unfold. Being a part of it is even more exciting.</p>

<p>What about you? If you want to be updated about, or even help write the next chapters, then

Just like <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/12/jenkins-community-survey-results-82.html">the last year</a>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/survey">we are running a survey this year</a>, to  get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">individual bug reports and feature requests</a> all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142">discussed what we wanted to ask</a> among ourselves and revised some more.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on &mdash; in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Last year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM</a>, picked up several key UI improvements, and <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements">we've actually delivered on those</a>. This year I hope to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The survey will close at the end of October, and if you participate, you'll get to see the results first. As an added incentive, CloudBees had pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card. So <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/survey">please let your voice be heard</a>.
