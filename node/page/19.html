<p><br/>
Jenkins comes with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting">the remoting library</a> that it uses to communicate between a master and slaves. This is a pretty awesome library, I think, which served us well.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the things this remoting layer does it to transfer the Java byte code on demand from the master to slaves on demand. This approach helps us keep slave deployment simple, as you don't have to keep the master and all the slaves in sync, but it also made the slave start-up slower, because none of the byte code loaded to slaves are kept around. It was all forgotten once the slave gets disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When slaves are static and stays online for hours, this wasn't a problem at all. But as more and more slaves become elastic (think EC2 or CloudBees DEV@cloud), This delay is becoming more and more noticeable. A similar issue happens when the Maven project type, which uses the same remoting library to talk to the running Maven build.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Another related performance bottleneck is the round-trip latency. When your slave is far away from a master, every classloading would incur a network round-trip, and it can add up quickly. This is because Java classloading abstraction is funamentally chatty.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jesse and I <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15120">started seriously thinking about this problem</a> last year, and we've <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/10">kept a branch going</a> to address this problem.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
After several trans-atlantic hacking during flights, we were finally able to release this in 1.519.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Starting this version, the remoting layer uses a local jar file cache to store jar files that were downloaded from the master. This pretty much eliminated the need to send class files over the wire.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In addition, the master will analyze class files as a slave request them and "push down" information about how related other classes should be loaded by the slave. This speculative "prefetching" saves the slave from making an expensive network round trip to the master.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In <a href="http://jenkins-ci.361315.n4.nabble.com/Efficient-class-jar-prefetching-in-remoting-td4665943.html">my benchmark using Maven builds, the prefetching cut the # of roundtrips to about half</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you do a lot of Maven builds, or if you have elastic slaves, we highly encourage you to upgrade.<br/>

Jenkins User Conference Israel Summary
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">Jenkins User Conference in Israel</a> was held this year on a different venue than the last year, because we have grown! I believe Shlomi Ben-Haim of JFrog said in his opening speech that the attendance has grown more than 50%, despite the ticket price increase.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, the event was held at a former Kibbutz turned into an event facility. This was rather fit for Jenkins for both emphasizes the community. The auditorium was big, the sky was bright & clear, and it was a wonderful day. JFrog folks even made a few Jenkins drapes (that I eventually brought back with me, so expect to see them)<br/>
<br/>

</a></div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For me, talks like one from Haggai are more interesting, as it shows me how Jenkins works in a domain that Iâ€™m not familiar with (in this case, .NET). And if you are Jenkins users, there are all sorts of talks, ranging from talks on CLI/XML interface of Jenkins (stuff for those who are writing tools and scripts that interface with Jenkins) to how someone managed user interface automation testing with Jenkins. Another talk that I got hooked was a talk from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel-abstracts.cb#YardenaMeymann">Yardena Meymann</a> about the review board Jenkins plugin that she wrote that lets you test out code change under the review, much the same way <a href="http://buildhive.cloudbees.com/">BuildHive</a> or <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+pull+request+builder+plugin">GitHub pull request builder plugin</a> does it for GitHub pull requests, but for Subversion. I also liked the 45 minutes format better, which helps cut the fat and take people straight to the point.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Outside talks, Israeli people kept me busy! They cornered me on multiple occasions and we had a lot of interesting conversations, so much so that I missed about half the talks! I just wish we had coordinated this upfront so that I could have visited them while I was there. This also made me wonder what if we designate one corner of the site and did a series of birds-of-feather around specific topics. This led me to try <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/">Jenkins Scalability Summit</a> in the upcoming JUC Palo Alto.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">All the slides and videos are available</a>, if you want to take a look --- be forewarned that some of them are in Hebrew.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you arenâ€™t in Israel but like the concept of JUC, looking forward to seeing you in the upcoming <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955">Jenkins User Conference in Palo Alto</a> this October.

Office hours this week: Git plugin refactoring
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This Wednesday's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">Jenkins office hours</a> is all about the Git plugin refactoring that's going on.</p>

<div style="float:right; margin:1em">
<img width="250" src="http://git-scm.com/images/logos/2color-lightbg@2x.png" />
</div>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Git plugin</a> is one of the most popular plugins out there, and it's been around for quite some time. Combine that with the fact that there are so many different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.</p>

<p>As early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London, and I've made a steadily progress since then and I'm ready for a wider review.</p>

<p>So we'll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I'll show you how the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it'll enable us in the future.</p>

<p>If the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what's cooking, please join us in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">the office hours</a> on Google Hangout.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you!</p>

Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH slaves
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
As the usage of Jenkins expands, we started seeing users who run multiple 100s of slaves on one master, and thus it became a lot more important for us to scale well to even larger number of slaves.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While I was looking at the thread dump of a large system, I started noticing that there are a large number of threads lying around pumping <tt>InputStream</tt> and writing to another <tt>OutputStream</tt>. On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So this morning, I tackled one source of such waste.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins has <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the ability to launch slave on a remote server via SSH</a> for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2">pure-Java implementation of SSH client</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 slaves connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you run a lot of slaves, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the SSH slaves plugin</a> to take advantages of this!<br/>

Giving Back to the Community:  3 Ways to Keep Jenkins Growing
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
With more than 600 plugins, Jenkins has a vibrant community and we're dependent on YOU to keep it that way. Here are 3 ways you can give back to the community to ensure that everyone benefits and Jenkins keeps growing...<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #1: vendor+community=win</h3><br/>
Jenkins is becoming ubiquitous enough that tool vendors and service providers often find their users asking them to provide Jenkins plugins. The challenge for these companies is that they donâ€™t necessarily possess the necessary Jenkins expertise to do one.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Here at the Jenkins project, what we are trying to do is to work with these people to deliver a plugin. It gets the job done a whole lot more quickly if the vendor brings in their expertise on their tool/services and we bring in our expertise on Jenkins plugin development.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For example, we recently worked with <a href="http://www.soasta.com/press-releases/soasta-and-cloudbees-partner-to-deliver-first-jenkins-plugin-for-continuous-integration-on-mobile-platforms/">SOASTA</a> to help them open-source the plugin they developed in house, then help them add a whole bunch of new functionalities. By open-sourcing a plugin in the Jenkins project, vendors win as the community helps fix bugs and improve plugins.  The Jenkins project wins by building relationship with vendors. And finally the users win by having more integrations.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So the next time you ask your vendor to provide a Jenkins integration, please tell them to drop us a note, and we are happy to talk.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #2: scratch your itch and take credit</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
If you are working for a company and hacking some Jenkins plugins for your team, then you should definitely consider contributing those changes back. Letâ€™s take <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/">Robert and Tomas</a> for example, who contributed a number of significant plugins from Sony Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><br/>
The company wins, because it shows off their technical excellence. Plus the flexibility to let engineers work on these OSS projects helps them retain and attract high-caliber developers. It also lets the community shoulder some of the burdens of maintaining plugins.<br/>
<li><br/>
You win, because now you have more things to show to future employers. After all, <a href="http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume">GitHub is your new resume</a>! And when you arenâ€™t sure how to go about implementing a feature or fixing a bug, open-sourcing your plugin lets us jump in and get you unstuck.<br/>
<li><br/>
The community wins, thanks to your new awesome plugin.<br/>
<li><br/>
Besides all of those pragmatic reasons, when you share something with others and they tell you how much it helped them, even if itâ€™s just one or two people, itâ€™s a deeply moving experience.<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It just has so many advantages, itâ€™s a no brainer!<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #3: contribute by proxy</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
If you are working for a company, wanting to see particular features/integrations in Jenkins but donâ€™t have time to do it yourself, thereâ€™s yet another way, and thatâ€™s to contribute by proxy.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The idea is that you contract with those who already know how to develop Jenkins plugins, and you have them produce/improve Jenkins plugins in open-source. <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Praqma">Praqma</a> is a great example of one such company. They are well connected in the community, with lots of experience under their belts, and your company takes the credit for the work. There are also a number of individuals who can do this for you.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Why give it away something for free when you paid for it, you might ask. Thatâ€™s because the code sitting in house rots when itâ€™s not maintained by anybody. In contrast, when the rest of the world can hack on your code, you get occasional random bug fixes by strangers (the worst case), and sometimes it gets its own life (the best case.)<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If this way of giving back suits you better, feel free to send an e-mail to <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">the dev list</a>.
