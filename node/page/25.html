<p><a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/12/jenkins-community-survey-results-82.html">Jenkins community survey result is in</a>, which shows a number of interesting stats for us developers, such as 82% of people saying their Jenkins is mission critical, or the spread of distributed builds, especially compared to <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2009/01/hudson_usage_an.html">my earlier similar usage analytics</a>.</p>

<p>But just as interesting is the free-form answers to questions like "If there was anything you could you change about Jenkins CI, what would it be?", and while the answer is colorful, there are a few common themes that one can easily spot.</p>

<p>One of them is "nothing!", which made me feel good, but another is "UI improvement." And incidentally, Domi has started <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-UI-enhancements-td4196887.html">a thread in the Jenkins-users list</a> about this exact topic a week ago.</p>

<p>The idea is to brainstorm what kind of concrete improvements people would like to see, then run them through some real user experience designers and decide which ones are good ideas and which ones are not.</p>

<p>I find this thread useful — so much so that one of those ideas (always show the "Save" button at the bottom in the config page) is already implemented toward the next release of Jenkins. So if you have some thoughts to share, please chime in on that thread.</p>

Thanks for the support PagerDuty!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Over drinks this evening <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> pointed out that he never saw a blog post about <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com">PagerDuty</a>.</p>

<center><a href="http://www.pagerduty.com"><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/pagerduty_logo.png" width="360" alt="pagerduty.com" /></a></center>

<p>If you've never worked in a sysadmin role or in any other position that would require an on-call rotation, then you may have never seen PagerDuty.</p>

<p>In essence the service provides a great series of integration points with Pingdom or Nagios for handling monitoring. As an infrastructure guy (part time), I can honestly say it's a great tool and I'm grateful to PagerDuty for supporting Jenkins with our own account to help manage project infrastructure.</p>

<p>A couple weekends ago I finished setting up <a href="http://nagios.jenkins-ci.org/nagios3/">Nagios</a> (read-only username/password: <code>jenkins</code>/<code>jenkins</code>) for critical project services which by itself is a good step forward. Combine that with PagerDuty's Nagios integration and a solid on-call rotation, and I'm more confident than I've ever been that Kohsuke or myself could actually take a vacation!</p>

<p>Check them out, and be sure to thank them on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/pagerduty">@PagerDuty</a> for supporting Jenkins!</p>

<p>Our <a href="/content/holiday-appeal-please-help-jenkins-pay-project-expense">earlier appeal</a> for donation was a drastic boost to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donation">our fund-raising drive</a>, (and looking at the twitter reactions, it feels like the Wikipedia parody we put on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins on Jenkins</a> helped spread the words — I guess jokes do work!</p>

<p>And I'm happy to report that we've successfully raised over $12000 as of today. That's more than enough to pay off all the current balance and it should keep the project going for quite a while. I've assembled <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donors">the donor list</a> in appreciation.</p>

<p>So once again, thanks everyone for their generous support!</p>

<p><br/>
As we approach the holiday season, which is when people start to feel more charitable, at least in the U.S. So I'd like to make one more plea, that the Jenkins project needs your help in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donation">paying its expense</a>, and that we are still about $1000 shy of the goal we need to get to. So if you can, please help us by <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160">donating to Jenkins via SPI</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Think about all the benefits you are getting from your Jenkins, and think about all the volunteer efforts that went into it. Some help by writing code, some help by answering other users questions, and some help by spreading words about Jenkins. If you've been wanting to contribute to the project but you haven't figured out how, this is one way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As a thank you, I'm writing a special "friend of Jenkins" plugin that I'd like to send out to those who have donated, so that you can show off your support on your Jenkins instance.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Once again, please help us reach <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donation">our fundraising goal</a>.<br/>

Community-contributed localizations to be bundled in Jenkins 1.443

<br/>
<p><br/>
In 1.430, we added <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin">the translation assistance plugin</a> in the hope of increasing the contribution from the community. It's been 3 months, and I've finally took the opportunity to integrate them into Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The result is pretty amazing. Before this, we had 26 languages, with wildly varying degree of completeness, such as French, Japanese, German, etc. This is still pretty good, but this integration added updates to 40 languages, including 17 brand-new languages, pushing the total up to whopping 43 languages. Among the newly added languages are Arabic (sorry, no right-to-left support yet), Esperanto, Hebrew, as well as large amount of Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and Korean.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While working with this, I've also discovered an issue that prevented Jenkins from correctly showing Hebrew, Indonesian, and Yedish localizations. All these changes will be in 1.443. And going forward, I'll be integrating changes more frequently to reduce the delay.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So big thank you for everyone who contributed localizations, and please keep them coming! <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin">Contributing localization is very easy</a>. If you are interested in more seriously working on localizations, please see <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Internationalization#Internationalization-Whattranslatorsneedtoknow%2Fdo">this Wiki page</a> and request the committership in the project. This is yet another way people can contribute to OSS without writing code.

The beginning of a new era: Ruby plugins now a reality
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jruby.png" align="right" width="180" alt="Yay JRuby!" /> It's not often that I get to use <em>that</em> much hyperbole in a Jenkins blog post, but I think in this case it's allowable. A journey that started over a year ago by <a href="https://twitter.com/cowboyd">Charles Lowell</a> has reached a new level, thanks to lots of help from <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> along with <a href="https://twitter.com/nahi">Hiroshi Nakamura</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jorgenpt">Jørgen Tjernø</a>.</p>

<p>As of today, with Jenkins 1.438, you can now <strong>download and install Ruby plugins from the update center</strong> (the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pathignore+Plugin">Path Ignore plugin</a> being the first).</p>

<p>Words simply can't express what a monumental achievement this is for the Jenkins project, both from the technical perspective but also in terms of what this means for the future of the project.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/languages">languages dashboard on GitHub</a>, Ruby is over two times as popular as Java on the site. I do not intend to start a language popularity contest here, but if we pretend just for a minute that the GitHub ecosystem is all that exists. Can you then imagine how powerful it would be to engage and include a community of open source developers that would be two times the size of the current pool of contributors? That's <strong>tremendous</strong> potential!</p>

<h3 id="great-where-do-i-start">Great! Where do I start?</h3>

<p>For those that are curious, the first officially released Ruby plugin for Jenkins is Jørgen's <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/pathignore-plugin">pathignore-plugin</a> which can be found in the update center. If you're looking for a reference project, this is currently the most up-to-date plugin.</p>

<p>There is also a <strong><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby">wiki page covering Ruby plugin development</a></strong>, which might be a little out-of-date but covers most of the essentials.</p>

<p>Additionally you might find the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-prototype-ruby-plugin">jenkins-prototype-plugin</a> an interesting resource as it is practically a kitchen sink of demo/test Ruby plugin code.</p>

<p>Currently only a few extension points (BuildStep, Publisher, BuildWrapper) are mapped in a Ruby-friendly manner. Don't let that scare you though! If you dig around in the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugin-runtime">jenkins-plugin-runtime</a> you can see how the existing extension points are mapped from Java into Ruby, because Ruby plugins are running under JRuby, if you need to access some Java APIs, you can do so without too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="the-thank-yous">The Thank Yous</h3>

<p>Great efforts like this one don't just happen without support, which is why I'd like to call out and thank <a href="http://thefrontside.net/">The FrontSide</a> for their <strong>wonderful</strong> support, helping to cover costs of WebEx for Office Hours and covering Charles' time while he worked with Kohsuke on the internal plumbing needed to make Ruby plugins possible within Jenkins core. If the name "The FrontSide" looks familiar to you, that might be because they also created and donated the Jenkins logo!</p>

<p>We should also thank <a href="http://www.mylookout.com">Lookout, Inc</a> (<em>full disclosure: Lookout is my employer</em>) and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> for affording some employee time for Jørgen and Kohsuke respectively to work on the project.</p>
