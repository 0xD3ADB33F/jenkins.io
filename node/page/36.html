<a href="http://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/usage-stats.gif"><img style="float:right; width:300px" src="http://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/usage-stats.gif"></a><a href="http://cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> announced the beta availability of their new Hudson-as-a-service "HaaS" today. I see this as <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/08/12/welcome-hudson-to-creative-commons/">yet</a> <a href="http://hudson-mobi.com/">another</a> <a href="http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-technical-talks-kohsuke-kawaguchi">validation</a> to Hudson, and as such, I welcome this new addition to the community and wish them well! &mdash; more companies betting on Hudson means we'll get more investment to the project, which is all goodness for Hudson users. It's been 5 months since I left Oracle to start <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a>, and I was initially worried about a possible negative impact on adoption, but instead Hudson has shown with no sign of slowing down (see picture on the right, from Andrew's report, which shows # of estimated active installations that participates to our usage stats survey).  And <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a> is going well too - we've helped <a href="http://infradna.com/customers">companies big and small</a> to improve their Hudson usage/adoption, and <a href="http://infradna.com/ichci">our commercial value-add Hudson distribution</a> is getting plenty of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Hosted Hudson offers an interesting trade-off, compared to on-premise Hudson. On the plus side, given the current hourly pricing of public clouds like EC2 and Rackspace, you get a better pricing model, as CloudBees charge by minutes. You also get rid of machines and upfront cost, which is great for small business. On top of that, you can also expect them to gradually develop more value-adds and better integration to various other pieces, which can get really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
On the down side, you have less control over the environment that runs the builds, and you do not have access back to your intranet environment (think databases that you need to talk to, for example.) Also, in the current pricing (8.5 cents/hour of EC2 vs 1 cent/minute of CB), if your build takes longer than 9 minutes, you'll save more by just using Hudson EC2 plugin.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I think one of the sweet spots is Hudson that's well integrated with on-premise cloud solution. As you can see in <a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/brian.chan/blog/-/blogs/improving-quality-with-100-hudson-test-servers">the discussion with Liferay Hudson setup</a>, with sufficient load it gets cheaper to have your own hardware, and many companies need some degree of control to the build/test environment that matches with their production environment. Plus with those on-premise virtualized environments, you can do <a href="http://www.govirtual.org/docs/DOC-1510">snapshots and forks</a>, which can be made to do <b>very</b> interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think the part that everyone can agree on is that the elasticity of build environment is hugely useful to the CI environment, as <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/articles/gen_hudson.jsp">I discussed in my JavaOne 2009 talk</a> (<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/download/attachments/37323793/Hudson+J1+2009.ppt?version=1&modificationDate=1244127211000">slides</a>.) I'm very happy to see that the foundation work we've made in Hudson for this is getting validated more and more, and I think the added elasticity will drive a lot more changes in Hudson and more broadly into the way we develop software. It is an exciting time!<br/>

In late 2008, the Hudson team released version 1.264 which added an anonymous reporting feature (you can opt-out in the "Manage Hudson" screen). The reporting feature has been sending information back to the Hudson team to help us understand how Hudson is used in aggregate; the info being reported includes the number of jobs configured, slave configurations, what plugins (and what versions of those plugins) are installed, and more. This data has not been available publicly until now! The raw data needed to be decrypted and scrubbed of any potentially identifying information, such as non-public plugin names or usernames in snapshot versions. We've finally scrubbed the data and are <strong>making it available</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
The data is currently in monthly JSON bundles, organized by unique install key. We've filtered out reports of installations without any jobs configured, as well as any installations with only one report in a given month. <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like access to the data, please send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net or jump onto the <A href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/chat">IRC channel</a> and ask - we'll send you the URL and a private username/password which you'll need to access the info. We're also planning to do more analysis of the data ourselves, for now feast your eyes on <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">this spreadsheet</a>, which shows the total number of unique installations seen per month and the number of unique installations of each publicly available plugin per month.<br/>

Quiet Period Feature

<p>Commits often come in a burst. This seems to happen mainly for two reasons — people sometimes forget to commit some files, and in the tranquility of waiting for your SCM to finish a commit, people sometimes realize the problems in the commit and they quickly make follow-up changes. The conventional wisdom is that the CI server should wait for the burst to finish before attempting a build. This is said to reduce the chance of having broken build, and it is also sometimes useful in reducing the average turn-around time for builds that take longer.</p>

<p>As such, Hudson is capable of waiting for a commit burst to be over before it triggers a new build, and this feature is called "quiet period." There are two parts in Hudson that interacts with the quiet period. One is the SCM polling behavior and the other is the queue.</p>

<p>The queue portion of the quiet period is straight-forward. When a build is scheduled into the queue with quiet period, the build will sit in the queue until the quiet period expires. If during this period, additional attempts are made to put the same build in the queue, the quiet period resets to its initial value. For example, if the quiet period is 5 minutes, and the build is put into the queue 9:00am and 9:03am, the actual build will only happen after 9:08am. Thus another way to think of the quiet period is that you are requiring a certain period of inactivity.</p>

<p>The above applies to all the mechanisms in Hudson that puts builds into the queue. This includes REST API call, CLI call, downstream triggers, and SCM pollings. So if you implement some kind of a "push" mechanism in your SCM to notify Hudson of a new commit, then you get the desired effect by just setting the quiet period in Hudson, and those push scripts don't have to do anything tricky.</p>

<p>It is also possible for some of those to override the quiet period configured in the project. For example, when you click "Build Now" button in your browser, your browser is making a REST API call, but with the quiet period of zero. I used to run a "push" script that looks into a commit message and overrides the quiet period by taking advantages of this feature.</p>

<p>The other portion of the quiet period that often matters is the SCM polling behaviour. Up until Hudson 1.346, the way Hudson defined the SCM abstraction made it impossible for SCMs to correctly report newly detected commits since the last polling. Instead, it was only possible to report if the repository is newer than the workspace. As a result, if the polling interval is set shorter than the quiet period, the build stayed in the quiet period forever. This was tracked in HUDSON-2180.</p>

<p>Hudson 1.346 fixed this issue, and so if you are using a newer version of Hudson and SCM plugins that take advantage of this improvement, then everything works as expected. Otherwise, avoid setting quiet period longer than the polling interval.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> in <strong>all</strong> Hudson versions prior to 1.371. The vulnerability was disclosed by <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> in the <a href="http://infradna.com/content/security-advisory-2010-08-09">following security advisory</a>, which details the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to use CLI commands that they are otherwise unauthorized for. CLI commands can perform various administrative operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is advised that <strong>all</strong> Hudson instances be upgraded immediately to avoid data loss or other ill effects from this issue. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.370, you can consult the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> for details on the other bug fixes and enhancements covered by the upgrade of your version to 1.371.</p>

<p>If you run a Hudson instance, it is recommended that Hudson system admins subscribe to either the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hudson-security-advisories">security advisories RSS feed</a> or the <a href="advisories-subscribe@hudson.dev.java.net">advisories@ mailing list</a>

As you may have noticed, thanks to the link on this and the other pages here at <a href="http://hudson-labs.org">hudson-labs.org</a>, the Hudson development community has recently introduced <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org">ci.hudson-labs.org</a>, the official Hudson-on-Hudson instance. We're currently building <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_main_trunk/">Hudson proper</a>, the <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_rc_branch/">Hudson core RC branch</a>, individual builds for <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Plugins/">the various Hudson plugins</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/gerrit_master/">Gerrit</a>, as well as various <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Libraries/">libraries</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Infrastructure/">infrastructure jobs</a> Hudson depends on.<br/>
<br/>
We're currently running all those builds on a dedicated Linux slave, generously provided to the Hudson project by <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, my employer. This has been great - except for the day when I'd just added all the individual plugin jobs for the first time, we haven't had real problems with capacity. But we are limited in the environments we can run our tests on as a result of only having a Linux slave. We're currently playing with a temporary Windows slave, but we'd really like to have at least one more permanent Windows slave, and a Mac slave as well, so that we can run Hudson's core integration tests on those platforms as well. Since this is Hudson we're talking about, we don't need the slave to be in any given physical location - we just need it to be running the slave process and talking to our server. If you're interested in helping us out with this, please contact me at andrew dot bayer at gmail dot com. Thanks!<br/>
