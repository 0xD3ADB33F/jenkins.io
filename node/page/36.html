Big Security Fix! Hudson 1.371 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> in <strong>all</strong> Hudson versions prior to 1.371. The vulnerability was disclosed by <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> in the <a href="http://infradna.com/content/security-advisory-2010-08-09">following security advisory</a>, which details the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to use CLI commands that they are otherwise unauthorized for. CLI commands can perform various administrative operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is advised that <strong>all</strong> Hudson instances be upgraded immediately to avoid data loss or other ill effects from this issue. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.370, you can consult the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> for details on the other bug fixes and enhancements covered by the upgrade of your version to 1.371.</p>

<p>If you run a Hudson instance, it is recommended that Hudson system admins subscribe to either the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hudson-security-advisories">security advisories RSS feed</a> or the <a href="advisories-subscribe@hudson.dev.java.net">advisories@ mailing list</a>
<!--break-->
â€”-</p>

<p>You can go grab the <a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/hudson/war/1.371/hudson.war">latest .war file</a> straight from our <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSL mirror</a> or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.</p>

Dogfooding Hudson - We're Looking for Slaves!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
As you may have noticed, thanks to the link on this and the other pages here at <a href="http://hudson-labs.org">hudson-labs.org</a>, the Hudson development community has recently introduced <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org">ci.hudson-labs.org</a>, the official Hudson-on-Hudson instance. We're currently building <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_main_trunk/">Hudson proper</a>, the <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_rc_branch/">Hudson core RC branch</a>, individual builds for <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Plugins/">the various Hudson plugins</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/gerrit_master/">Gerrit</a>, as well as various <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Libraries/">libraries</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Infrastructure/">infrastructure jobs</a> Hudson depends on.<br/>
<br/>
We're currently running all those builds on a dedicated Linux slave, generously provided to the Hudson project by <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, my employer. This has been great - except for the day when I'd just added all the individual plugin jobs for the first time, we haven't had real problems with capacity. But we are limited in the environments we can run our tests on as a result of only having a Linux slave. We're currently playing with a temporary Windows slave, but we'd really like to have at least one more permanent Windows slave, and a Mac slave as well, so that we can run Hudson's core integration tests on those platforms as well. Since this is Hudson we're talking about, we don't need the slave to be in any given physical location - we just need it to be running the slave process and talking to our server. If you're interested in helping us out with this, please contact me at andrew dot bayer at gmail dot com. Thanks!<br/>

Hosting your Hudson plugin at Github
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
For as long as Hudson's had a plugin model and development community, we've provided <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">source code and binary hosting</a> through our Subversion repo at <a href="http://java.net">java.net</a>. But what if you're a plugin developer and you don't want to use Subversion? Well, we have an alternative for your source code: host it with <a href="http://github.com/hudson">Hudson on GitHub<a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://www.hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/octocat.png" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Octocat!" width="180"/><br/>
<br/>
To get this in place, send an email to <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">dev@hudson.dev.java.net</a> (or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a>) asking to get a repository created for your plugin at Github. Make sure to include the name of the plugin and your Github username (and the Github usernames of any other developers who'll be pushing to your plugin's repo). If your plugin is already in Github, include the URL for the existing repo so that we can fork it. One of the Hudson admins will create the repository (forking if appropriate) and add the user(s) to the list of users with push access to the Hudson-hosted repositories at Github. Once you hear back from them, you'll be able to push code to the new repository.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to make a few changes to your plugin's POM, as compared to what works for a plugin POM in the java.net Subversion tree.<br/>
<!--break--><br/>
<strong>First</strong>, add the following to the <code><build><plugins></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
      <plugin><br/>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId><br/>
        <version>2.0</version><br/>
        <dependencies><br/>
          <dependency><br/>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.scm</groupId><br/>
            <artifactId>maven-scm-provider-gitexe</artifactId><br/>
            <version>1.3</version><br/>
          </dependency><br/>
        </dependencies><br/>
      </plugin><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed to make sure we're overriding the parent POM's SCM provider settings. Next, add the following to the <code><build></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
    <extensions><br/>
      <extension><br/>
        <groupId>org.jvnet.wagon-svn</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>wagon-svn</artifactId><br/>
        <version>1.9</version><br/>
      </extension><br/>
    </extensions><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed because we're still going to be using wagon-svn to deploy the artifacts in the release process. Lastly, add an <code><scm></code> section, within the <code><project></code> section of the POM, like the following:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
  <scm><br/>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</connection><br/>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</developerConnection><br/>
    <url>http://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo</url><br/>
  </scm><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
As with the first section, this is needed to override the default SCM settings in the parent POM. Make sure to change "your-plugin-repo" to your actual plugin repository name, of course! It'd also be a good idea to put a link to your Github repo on your plugin's wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">the Hudson wiki</a>, since the default source link will go to Subversion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with these changes in place, committed and pushed to the master branch in your plugin's repository, you should be able to run "mvn release:prepare release:perform" just as you would if the plugin were hosted in Subversion, with your plugin showing up in the Update Center within a few hours. Be sure that you've configured the login information for the java.net Maven repository, as detailed <a href="https://javanettasks.dev.java.net/nonav/maven/config.html">here</a> - this is still needed for plugins hosted at and released from Github, since Hudson's Maven repository still lives at java.net. If you run into any issues releasing your plugin from Github, first be sure to review the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">wiki page on plugin hosting</a>, which addresses many of the issues you may encounter when running the Maven release plugin. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're still stumped, feel free to email <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">the Hudson developer list</a> or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a> for help.<br/>

Hudson 1.368 Released!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Regular readers will recognize that I've been slacking off quite a bit lately with my release announcements, my apologies. With the release of 1.368 on Sunday, which fixed a few fairly important bugs, I figured I'd dusty off my blogging fedora and give this a shot.</p>

<p>This release has three bug fixes in it which were causing some issues for some users, particularly those deploying Hudson inside the recently released <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html">Tomcat 7.0</a> (see <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6738">issue 6738</a>).</p>

<p>Hudson users utilizing the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Tool+Auto-Installation">JDK auto-installation</a> feature between different platforms may have been affected by <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6880">issue 6880</a> which was also fixed in this release.</p>

<p>Bringing up the rear is the fix to <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7004">issue 7004</a> which detailed a few discrepencies between the <code>/buildWithParameters</code> and the <code>/build</code> remote APIs.</p>

<p>If you're not affected by these issues, you may want to wait for the soon-to-be-released 1.369 which has <strong>even more</strong> juicy bug fixes in it (with a dash of enhancements) to upgrade.

<p>The good folks over at Sauce Labs have gotten around to posting some of the videos taken with Kohsuke.</p>

<p>Instead of embed the videos, I wanted to directly <strong><a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/07/sfse-meetup-videos-hudson-with-selenium-sauce-ondemand/">link to the post</a></strong> and make sure that you all went over to check out Sauce Labs, they're up to some interesting things over there.</p>
