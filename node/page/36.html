Hosting your Hudson plugin at Github
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
For as long as Hudson's had a plugin model and development community, we've provided <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">source code and binary hosting</a> through our Subversion repo at <a href="http://java.net">java.net</a>. But what if you're a plugin developer and you don't want to use Subversion? Well, we have an alternative for your source code: host it with <a href="http://github.com/hudson">Hudson on GitHub<a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://www.hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/octocat.png" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Octocat!" width="180"/><br/>
<br/>
To get this in place, send an email to <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">dev@hudson.dev.java.net</a> (or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a>) asking to get a repository created for your plugin at Github. Make sure to include the name of the plugin and your Github username (and the Github usernames of any other developers who'll be pushing to your plugin's repo). If your plugin is already in Github, include the URL for the existing repo so that we can fork it. One of the Hudson admins will create the repository (forking if appropriate) and add the user(s) to the list of users with push access to the Hudson-hosted repositories at Github. Once you hear back from them, you'll be able to push code to the new repository.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to make a few changes to your plugin's POM, as compared to what works for a plugin POM in the java.net Subversion tree.<br/>
<!--break--><br/>
<strong>First</strong>, add the following to the <code><build><plugins></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
      <plugin><br/>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId><br/>
        <version>2.0</version><br/>
        <dependencies><br/>
          <dependency><br/>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.scm</groupId><br/>
            <artifactId>maven-scm-provider-gitexe</artifactId><br/>
            <version>1.3</version><br/>
          </dependency><br/>
        </dependencies><br/>
      </plugin><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed to make sure we're overriding the parent POM's SCM provider settings. Next, add the following to the <code><build></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
    <extensions><br/>
      <extension><br/>
        <groupId>org.jvnet.wagon-svn</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>wagon-svn</artifactId><br/>
        <version>1.9</version><br/>
      </extension><br/>
    </extensions><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed because we're still going to be using wagon-svn to deploy the artifacts in the release process. Lastly, add an <code><scm></code> section, within the <code><project></code> section of the POM, like the following:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
  <scm><br/>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</connection><br/>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</developerConnection><br/>
    <url>http://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo</url><br/>
  </scm><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
As with the first section, this is needed to override the default SCM settings in the parent POM. Make sure to change "your-plugin-repo" to your actual plugin repository name, of course! It'd also be a good idea to put a link to your Github repo on your plugin's wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">the Hudson wiki</a>, since the default source link will go to Subversion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with these changes in place, committed and pushed to the master branch in your plugin's repository, you should be able to run "mvn release:prepare release:perform" just as you would if the plugin were hosted in Subversion, with your plugin showing up in the Update Center within a few hours. Be sure that you've configured the login information for the java.net Maven repository, as detailed <a href="https://javanettasks.dev.java.net/nonav/maven/config.html">here</a> - this is still needed for plugins hosted at and released from Github, since Hudson's Maven repository still lives at java.net. If you run into any issues releasing your plugin from Github, first be sure to review the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">wiki page on plugin hosting</a>, which addresses many of the issues you may encounter when running the Maven release plugin. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're still stumped, feel free to email <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">the Hudson developer list</a> or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a> for help.<br/>

Hudson 1.368 Released!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Regular readers will recognize that I've been slacking off quite a bit lately with my release announcements, my apologies. With the release of 1.368 on Sunday, which fixed a few fairly important bugs, I figured I'd dusty off my blogging fedora and give this a shot.</p>

<p>This release has three bug fixes in it which were causing some issues for some users, particularly those deploying Hudson inside the recently released <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html">Tomcat 7.0</a> (see <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6738">issue 6738</a>).</p>

<p>Hudson users utilizing the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Tool+Auto-Installation">JDK auto-installation</a> feature between different platforms may have been affected by <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6880">issue 6880</a> which was also fixed in this release.</p>

<p>Bringing up the rear is the fix to <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7004">issue 7004</a> which detailed a few discrepencies between the <code>/buildWithParameters</code> and the <code>/build</code> remote APIs.</p>

<p>If you're not affected by these issues, you may want to wait for the soon-to-be-released 1.369 which has <strong>even more</strong> juicy bug fixes in it (with a dash of enhancements) to upgrade.

A Python Love Story: Virtualenv and Hudson
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
Over the past year Hudson has grown tremendously, both within the Java community and outside of it. Partially thanks to [Titus Brown](http://twitter.com/ctitusbrown)'s PyCon 2010 Atlanta coverage of continuous integration for Python (which we've [covered before](http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-pycon)), Hudson has made great strides within the Python community as well.

In my experience, the majority of Python developers are not using Hudson to **build** anything, unless they have C extensions, but rather to *test* their packages, which presents its own set of specific requirements for jobs. Jobs for testing Python code need to be able to reliaby reproduce an environment with the same set of dependencies from one run to the next in order to provide consistent testing. Unlike their Java counterparts, Python developers cannot rely on a powerful system like <a id="aptureLink_5i6m9B8BGf" href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven2</a> for enumerating build/test targets or defining their project's dependencies in their jobs; fortunately, w
e can have something close: [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

Virtualenv does exactly what you might expect it to, it creates a "virtual environment" with custom `site-packages` directory, and modified `python` executable. Using virtualenv you can create a staged environment to use for running unit and integration tests. Adding pip alongside that and you have a **fantastic** Python package manager/installer to use with the virtual environment.

Below, I've outlined the steps required to use virtualenv and pip to *automatically* manage a custom environment for your Python jobs.
<!--break-->
### The Recipe

For this recipe to work, you should make sure that your slave machines all have `virtualenv` and `pip` installed and accessible from your slave agent's `$PATH`. For Mac OS X users, `sudo easy_install virtualenv` should do the trick, Linux users should be able to run `sudo [aptitude/yum/zypper] install python-virtualenv` with your respective package manager.

You will also need the [SetEnv Plugin](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Setenv+Plugin) installed in Hudson.

#### Step 1

Inside of the job's configuration page ([http;//hudson/job/configure](http://hudson/job/configure)), we need to define an environment variable for the job. Using the SetEnv plugin, define a new `$PATH`:

<code type="bash">
    PATH=.env/bin:$PATH</code>

What this will do is modify the `$PATH` environment variable for all of the "Execute shell" build steps in your job. As you might have guessed, we're going to install the virtualenv in `.env` in the workspace root directory.

#### Step 2

To set up the virtualenv, you want to add a build step of type "Execute shell" and paste the following commands into the text area:

<code type="bash">
    if [ -d ".env" ]; then
        echo "**> virtualenv exists"
    else
        echo "**> creating virtualenv"
        virtualenv .env
    fi
</code>

This will create a virtualenv the first time the job runs on a particular slave, a virtualenv that will persist until the workspace is cleared. Since we're going to install dependencies in the virtualenv, we want to keep it around between jobs to reduce the amount of network hits to download packages.

#### Step 3

With our virtualenv and our `$PATH` properly set up, the job can now properly install dependencies into its virtualenv, this is where `pip` shines. A little known feature of `pip` allows you to define a "requirements file" which enumerates the packages to install. In my example project, I defined the following requirements in a file called `pip-requires.txt`

<code type="bash">
    eventlet>=0.9.9
    nose>=0.11.3
    MySQL-python>=1.2.3c1
</code>

In my hypothetical example, I'll need `nose` to run my tests, while `eventlet` and `MySQL-python` are required for my project to properly run. With the `pip-requires.txt` file in the root of my source repository, I can add an additional "Execute shell" build step that does the following:

<code type="bash">
    pip install -r pip-requires.txt
</code>

Assuming the `$PATH` environment variable was properly defined, this will use the virtualenv's version of `pip` and it will install the packages defined in `pip-requires.txt` **into** the virtualenv!

With the dependencies all properly installed in the virtualenv, I can now configure the remainder of my job to build my project and execute the tests. Pretty snazzy if you ask me!
