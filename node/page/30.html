What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation
virtually any project

<a href='/blog/2011/03/23/windows-installers-are-now-available/'>
Windows installers are now available
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Good portion of Java developers use Windows, so we tend to think the opposite is true, that a good portion of Windows folks use Java. But this is not true.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As Jenkins gains traction among .NET developers, it's becoming increasingly clear that Java is very alien to them. They naturally have no idea of what a war file means, and often don't even have Java installed, and so it was <i>just not easy enough</i> for them to start using Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I'm happy to report that I've finally fixed this problem with the new Windows installer. It is primarily packaged as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer">an MSI file</a> &mdash; a common format that seasoned Windows devs/admins are familiar with. It can, for example, be deployed remotely on a large number of servers via Active Directory remotely. Or you can just double-click it to install it interactively. It bundles JRE, so no separate Java installation is needed.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The package also contains the bootstrap <tt>setup.exe</tt>, to install .NET 2.0 runtime if it's not installed yet. Between that and JRE, it got all the dependencies covered. I tested that by installing it on a fresh Windows XP install.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So I hope this makes Jenkins more attractive to .NET and other developers who live and die by Windows.

The polls are open for the Jenkins Logo Contest!

<div class='content'>
<p>After a number of <strong>absolutely</strong> fantastic logo submissions from a number of designers, I'm extremely pleased to open the polls on the vote for the <strong><em>brand new Jenkins logo!</em></strong></p>

<p>The thumbnails do not do any of these logos justice in my opinion, so I recommend opening each logo up in its own tab to get the full effect :)</p>

<p>I plan to end voting <strong>March 28th at 12:01 UTC</strong>.</p>

Jenkins hits 1.400
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> is now at 1.400 (as of last Monday, yes, I know. But better late than never...). As with <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/04/22/hudson-hits-1300?force=752">1.300</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/hudson_hits_120.html?force=824">1.200</a>, this release doesn't particularly signify any substantial major release, but nonetheless it is a milestone for those of us who are involved in the project &mdash; I think repeating something 400 times is something one can be proud of. It's a bit like climbing a mountain. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, ... and when you look up, voila!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In 2 years since 1.300, which was April 2009, we've added a lot of features. We now have a CLI to manipulate the server, auto-installation of JDK/Ant/Maven to simplify cluster management, concurrent builds of the same job, community-contributed localizations to 20+ languages, boolean expression over the job/label assignment control, parallel initialization based on a dynamically built acyclic directed graph, console annotations to enrich the build output, far more extensible queue (that enabled a lot of plugins), Windows 7 / Vista support, improved master/slave communication stability, Maven 3 support, and then all around performance improvements, in memory footprint, in startup time, and in page rendering speed.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And of course, we had to change the name of the project. That was a real distraction, but now that the divorce is over, things have been <a href="http://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2011/03/jenkins-vs-hudson-time-to-upgrade.html">moving well</a> for Jenkins. I guess any organization (including any sizable OSS project) is really more than sum of all individuals. If you take a store of Target and replace all its workers by those of nearby Staples, it'll probably not work out well. I think <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/why">people understand that</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And on the positive side, I do think we came out stronger. We are now running <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/node/280">governance meetings on IRC</a>, we now have <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins">somewhat more formal governance structure</a>. The core development is actually accelarating with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/impact">many new developers</a>, such as Olivier Lamy, (scroll to the right), and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jenkins_release">plugin releases kept coming at amazing rate</a> &mdash; we are now at 350+ plugins, more than doubled since 1.300.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Looking at future, we are working on a number of new initiatives in the community, too. For example, Arnaud Héritier is working on revisiting <a href="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/">our JIRA project structure</a>, Andrew Bayer is running a contest for new logo, Tyler is in process of getting additional hardwares at OSUOSL for the project. I'm also doing a lot of things, but for example, I'm going to write a proposal to start a stable patch releases of Jenkins that only consists of backported important bug fixes, in addition to the current weekly release model. Several large users maintain private branches of Jenkins, and so I think it makes a lot of sense for those folks to align their efforts around this release line. I'm also thinking that we could launch a community acceptance testing (CAT) effort around this, much like <a href="http://qa.netbeans.org/processes/cat/67/faqs.html">NetBeans</a> and <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/quality/portal/">GlassFish</a> have done it. I think the first stable release line would branch off from 1.400, so if anything that's another reason you should upgrade to 1.400.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When I reflect on the project, I'm surprised at just how much work there is to be done, after so much that has been achived. But I'm still excited at what we can do with this platform. I thank everyone for their continued patoronage of Jenkins, and I hope to see more of you in the mailing lists, in the chat rooms, and in the meet-up events. And here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">to infinity and beyond!</a><br/>

<a href='/blog/2011/03/03/updated-usage-stats-available/'>
Updated Usage Stats Available!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Updated usage statistics are now available at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/census">http://jenkins-ci.org/census</a> This data has been scrubbed of distinguishing information as much as possible, filtered for installations we've seen at least twice a month with at least one job set up, and split up into monthly JSON files. Starting with August, we only have data on installations of version 1.368 or later - before that, reports go to the old Oracle-owned server, and we aren't able to retrieve them. So that's why you'll see a fairly hefty drop in install count, etc from July to August.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to do any analysis to speak of on the data. I intend to get the <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">plugin usage spreadsheet</a> updated n the next few days, but I wanted to make this data available to you all ASAP. If you come up with any interesting analysis or use of the data, please let us know!</p>

<p><br/>
I'll be visiting Tokyo again for the week of 2/21 for a number of events.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Tokyo Jenkins User Meetup</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
The Japanese Jenkins user community may not be as visible from outside but very strong. This is the 2nd meet up in Tokyo, and once again we maxed out the 80 people room capacity in just a few days (but you can <a href="http://kokucheese.com/event/index/6710/">still RSVP for the social event</a> after the meetup.) This meetup is focused on Java & Jenkins, so we have a number of speakers lined up to discuss hwo they use Jenkins in their Java projects. This will be the first user meetup event after the name has changed to Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>CloudBees Jenkins training in Tokyo</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
I'll deliver this one-day training course, all about Jenkins from the setup to continuous deployment to code analysis. If you are interested, you can find <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/training_ja.cb">more details about this</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Japan Grails/Groovy User Group (JGGUG)</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins internally use Groovy a lot in many places (as well as some of its peripheral tools depend on Groovy.) So I'll be speaking in the JGGUG meetup event, on behalf of the Jenkins project, and highlight those usages and how much we all love Groovy. Yes, I do.<br/>
<!--break--><br/>
<p><br/>
Aside from these public events, I have a few visits planned to various companies. If you are interested in having me over and look at your Jenkins, or want to discuss something, please let me know at kk at kohsuke dot org.

First Governance Meeting Recap
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As mentioned <a href="/content/governance-meeting-today">on Friday</a> the Jenkins project held it's first meeting on the <a href="/content/chat">IRC channel</a> at the request of the interim board. In the interest of transparency, we recorded meeting minutes and tried to involve as many folks as possible.</p>

<h4 id="topics-covered">Topics Covered</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proposal/Discussion of Jenkins project governance structure</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What to do about the logo</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Registering the Jenkins trademark</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Moving Jenkins under an umbrella organization</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What shall we do with a new CLA?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Logistics for the next project meeting</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested, you can read through the <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.log.html">full logs</a> or just look over the high-level <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.html">meeting minutes</a>.</p>

<p>This first meeting went a bit long due to the massive amount of items needing to be discussed, so the project has scheduled another meeting for <strong>Wednesday Feb 9, 11am PST (19:00 UTC)</strong>; mark your calendars!</p>

<p>Thanks to everybody who participated, we'll see you again next time.</p>

The first 24 hours in downloads
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As I had mentioned in <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/installing-plugins-has-always-been-easy-now-its-fast-too">a previous post</a> back when Jenkins was called something else, who can remember what anymore, I spent a lot of time working on a mirroring network. With our departure from any and all Oracle infrastructure, this mirroring network has now become our sole distribution mechanism for pushing out <strong>all</strong> releases and <strong>all</strong> plugins, in short, <strong>lots and lots of bits</strong>.</p>

<p>Just how much data are we now distributing through the Jenkins mirror network?</p>

<p><strong><big>Over 52GB in 24 hours</big></strong></p>

<p>Here's the following in terms of a loose breakdown of the number of files served over the past day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>788 <code>.war</code></li>
  <li>447 <code>.deb</code></li>
  <li>290 <code>.rpm</code></li>
  <li>1759 <code>.hpi</code> (plugins)</li>
</ul>

<p>We're off to a great start! I'd like to extend my thanks again to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.xmission.com">XMission</a> for their help getting the Jenkins mirrors functional as soon as possible
