Jenkins hits 1.400
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> is now at 1.400 (as of last Monday, yes, I know. But better late than never...). As with <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/04/22/hudson-hits-1300?force=752">1.300</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/hudson_hits_120.html?force=824">1.200</a>, this release doesn't particularly signify any substantial major release, but nonetheless it is a milestone for those of us who are involved in the project &mdash; I think repeating something 400 times is something one can be proud of. It's a bit like climbing a mountain. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, ... and when you look up, voila!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In 2 years since 1.300, which was April 2009, we've added a lot of features. We now have a CLI to manipulate the server, auto-installation of JDK/Ant/Maven to simplify cluster management, concurrent builds of the same job, community-contributed localizations to 20+ languages, boolean expression over the job/label assignment control, parallel initialization based on a dynamically built acyclic directed graph, console annotations to enrich the build output, far more extensible queue (that enabled a lot of plugins), Windows 7 / Vista support, improved master/slave communication stability, Maven 3 support, and then all around performance improvements, in memory footprint, in startup time, and in page rendering speed.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And of course, we had to change the name of the project. That was a real distraction, but now that the divorce is over, things have been <a href="http://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2011/03/jenkins-vs-hudson-time-to-upgrade.html">moving well</a> for Jenkins. I guess any organization (including any sizable OSS project) is really more than sum of all individuals. If you take a store of Target and replace all its workers by those of nearby Staples, it'll probably not work out well. I think <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/why">people understand that</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And on the positive side, I do think we came out stronger. We are now running <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/node/280">governance meetings on IRC</a>, we now have <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins">somewhat more formal governance structure</a>. The core development is actually accelarating with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/graphs/impact">many new developers</a>, such as Olivier Lamy, (scroll to the right), and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jenkins_release">plugin releases kept coming at amazing rate</a> &mdash; we are now at 350+ plugins, more than doubled since 1.300.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Looking at future, we are working on a number of new initiatives in the community, too. For example, Arnaud HÃ©ritier is working on revisiting <a href="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/">our JIRA project structure</a>, Andrew Bayer is running a contest for new logo, Tyler is in process of getting additional hardwares at OSUOSL for the project. I'm also doing a lot of things, but for example, I'm going to write a proposal to start a stable patch releases of Jenkins that only consists of backported important bug fixes, in addition to the current weekly release model. Several large users maintain private branches of Jenkins, and so I think it makes a lot of sense for those folks to align their efforts around this release line. I'm also thinking that we could launch a community acceptance testing (CAT) effort around this, much like <a href="http://qa.netbeans.org/processes/cat/67/faqs.html">NetBeans</a> and <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/quality/portal/">GlassFish</a> have done it. I think the first stable release line would branch off from 1.400, so if anything that's another reason you should upgrade to 1.400.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When I reflect on the project, I'm surprised at just how much work there is to be done, after so much that has been achived. But I'm still excited at what we can do with this platform. I thank everyone for their continued patoronage of Jenkins, and I hope to see more of you in the mailing lists, in the chat rooms, and in the meet-up events. And here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">to infinity and beyond!</a><br/>

Updated Usage Stats Available!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Updated usage statistics are now available at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/census">http://jenkins-ci.org/census</a> This data has been scrubbed of distinguishing information as much as possible, filtered for installations we've seen at least twice a month with at least one job set up, and split up into monthly JSON files. Starting with August, we only have data on installations of version 1.368 or later - before that, reports go to the old Oracle-owned server, and we aren't able to retrieve them. So that's why you'll see a fairly hefty drop in install count, etc from July to August.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to do any analysis to speak of on the data. I intend to get the <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">plugin usage spreadsheet</a> updated n the next few days, but I wanted to make this data available to you all ASAP. If you come up with any interesting analysis or use of the data, please let us know!</p>

<p><br/>
I'll be visiting Tokyo again for the week of 2/21 for a number of events.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Tokyo Jenkins User Meetup</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
The Japanese Jenkins user community may not be as visible from outside but very strong. This is the 2nd meet up in Tokyo, and once again we maxed out the 80 people room capacity in just a few days (but you can <a href="http://kokucheese.com/event/index/6710/">still RSVP for the social event</a> after the meetup.) This meetup is focused on Java & Jenkins, so we have a number of speakers lined up to discuss hwo they use Jenkins in their Java projects. This will be the first user meetup event after the name has changed to Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>CloudBees Jenkins training in Tokyo</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
I'll deliver this one-day training course, all about Jenkins from the setup to continuous deployment to code analysis. If you are interested, you can find <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/training_ja.cb">more details about this</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Japan Grails/Groovy User Group (JGGUG)</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins internally use Groovy a lot in many places (as well as some of its peripheral tools depend on Groovy.) So I'll be speaking in the JGGUG meetup event, on behalf of the Jenkins project, and highlight those usages and how much we all love Groovy. Yes, I do.<br/>
<!--break--><br/>
<p><br/>
Aside from these public events, I have a few visits planned to various companies. If you are interested in having me over and look at your Jenkins, or want to discuss something, please let me know at kk at kohsuke dot org.

First Governance Meeting Recap
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As mentioned <a href="/content/governance-meeting-today">on Friday</a> the Jenkins project held it's first meeting on the <a href="/content/chat">IRC channel</a> at the request of the interim board. In the interest of transparency, we recorded meeting minutes and tried to involve as many folks as possible.</p>

<h4 id="topics-covered">Topics Covered</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proposal/Discussion of Jenkins project governance structure</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What to do about the logo</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Registering the Jenkins trademark</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Moving Jenkins under an umbrella organization</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What shall we do with a new CLA?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Logistics for the next project meeting</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested, you can read through the <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.log.html">full logs</a> or just look over the high-level <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.html">meeting minutes</a>.</p>

<p>This first meeting went a bit long due to the massive amount of items needing to be discussed, so the project has scheduled another meeting for <strong>Wednesday Feb 9, 11am PST (19:00 UTC)</strong>; mark your calendars!</p>

<p>Thanks to everybody who participated, we'll see you again next time.</p>

The first 24 hours in downloads

<div class='content'>
<p>As I had mentioned in <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/installing-plugins-has-always-been-easy-now-its-fast-too">a previous post</a> back when Jenkins was called something else, who can remember what anymore, I spent a lot of time working on a mirroring network. With our departure from any and all Oracle infrastructure, this mirroring network has now become our sole distribution mechanism for pushing out <strong>all</strong> releases and <strong>all</strong> plugins, in short, <strong>lots and lots of bits</strong>.</p>

<p>Just how much data are we now distributing through the Jenkins mirror network?</p>

<p><strong><big>Over 52GB in 24 hours</big></strong></p>

<p>Here's the following in terms of a loose breakdown of the number of files served over the past day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>788 <code>.war</code></li>
  <li>447 <code>.deb</code></li>
  <li>290 <code>.rpm</code></li>
  <li>1759 <code>.hpi</code> (plugins)</li>
</ul>

<p>We're off to a great start! I'd like to extend my thanks again to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.xmission.com">XMission</a> for their help getting the Jenkins mirrors functional as soon as possible

Governance Meeting Today
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Amongst all the work this week with setting up project infrastructure, <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.396/">the first release of Jenkins</a> and a <em>flood</em> of developer activity <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">on GitHub</a>, the interim governance board has decided to hold periodic virtual meetings.</p>

<p>The first meeting will be held <strong>today</strong> at 3pm PST (23:00 UTC) in the <code>#jenkins</code> channel on IRC (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/">Kohsuke's</a> post to the mailing list, he further explained the goals of such meetings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use it to report/discuss various issues of the project (not bugs in code, but more project level stuff.) I also plan to report the infrastructure work that's done thus far.</p>

  <p>We'd like to hear from you, and the point is to engage the broader community, so please join us.</p>

  <p>This is a new thing, so it's not like we've figured this all out, but let's see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the Freenode <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat client</a> to join in, hope to see you there!

Jenkins!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>(This was sent as an email to the Hudson dev and users mailing lists after voting concluded, but I thought it'd be good to post it here as well.)</p>

<p>The vote is closed, and the results are in. More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-jenkins-vote">hudson-jenkins-vote</a>.
<!--break-->
So what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We've registered jenkins-ci.org, though it's empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">@jenkinsci</a>, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We're working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.</p>

<p>Putting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle's project, nor CloudBee's project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke's project - it's the community's project, and it's going to thrive.</p>

<a href='/blog/2011/01/11/hudsons-future/'>
Hudson's future
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>First, my apologies for the lack of updates on the <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">Hudson/Oracle situation</a> for
the last few weeks. While talks have been ongoing, the holidays have slowed
things down, and we didn't want to send out information that would later turn
out not to be true. We've been waiting for the talks to reach a resolution -
and I believe they now have.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.java.net">java.net</a> migration problems, Oracle and representatives from the
Hudson community have been involved in talks on the future of the project in a
number of areas. The Hudson representatives have been <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">myself</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke
Kawaguchi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a>  (CEO of CloudBees and Kohsuke's boss), who was
brought in to help provide experience with discussions on a corporate/executive
level which neither Kohsuke nor I have, with Alan Harder and <a href="http://twitter.com/agentdero">R. Tyler Croy</a>
advising on the side.</p>

<p>These talks have in many ways been fruitful - we came to working agreements
with Oracle on the project infrastructure (such as mailing lists and SCM
repository location), code review policy for Hudson core, and perhaps most
significantly, a governance structure for the project going forward. Some
issues are not yet entirely resolved, such as questions on restrictions on
third party dependency licenses. But one issue, which we feel is the most
significant issue of all, one for which we now believe no resolution is
possible: the rights to the name <strong>Hudson</strong>.</p>

<p>Oracle has told us that they have trademark applications filed in both the EU
and US for Hudson, based on Hudson's creation by Kohsuke while working at Sun.
The problem is that this trademark ownership gives Oracle the ability to revoke
the Hudson project's right to call itself Hudson at any time, and while Oracle
has made an attempt to offer some guarantees (most notably, that binary
releases of Hudson, once they've been released with the name Hudson attached,
will always retain the right to the name), they are not offering any binding
guarantee that the Hudson project will be able to retain its use of the name in
perpetuity.</p>

<p>Therefore, to continue using the name Hudson means ceding some of the project's
independence to Oracle - if the project and its governance board opted to go in
a direction Oracle disapproved of, Oracle would be able to take away the naming
rights. Or, in a less dramatic scenario, Oracle could insist on certain changes
to the code, infrastructure decisions, process, etc, regardless of opposition
from the Hudson development community, in order to retain the rights to the
name.</p>

<p>In short, we'd be living under a sword of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Damocles">Damocles</a>, regardless of the goodwill
of the individuals we've been negotiating with at Oracle - Hudson as a project
would be beholden to Oracle's whims for its continued use of its own name, and
we believe that's not viable.
<!--break-->
As I see it, the only viable option facing the project now is to rename it, in
order to free it from the burden of Oracle's ownership of its name. This is not
a first choice, not by a long shot, but I don't see any other choice available
to us that would preserve the integrity of the project going forward. Oracle
will be presenting their proposal for the project continuing under their
umbrella - I encourage you to read it when it becomes available and weigh it
accordingly. I'll just focus on what Kohsuke, other prominent Hudson community
members and I have endorsed.</p>

<h3 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h3>

<p>First, we rename the project - the choice for a new name is <strong>Jenkins</strong>, which we
think evokes the same sort of English butler feel as Hudson. We've already
registered domains, Twitter users, etc for the new name, and have done our best
to verify that there are no existing trademarks which would conflict with it.
Kohsuke will be registering the trademark for Jenkins in his name, with the
intent of transferring ownership of the trademark to the umbrella of the
<a href="http://www.sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> once the Jenkins project has been admitted to it
(which, I should add, is very much our plan, hopefully in their next round of
new projects in a few months - we've already had preliminary contacts with
SFC). We still invite Oracle to remain involved with the project, on equal
terms with all other contributors, and hope they'll take us up on this
invitation.</p>

<p>Second, out of respect for Oracle's trademark claim on Hudson, we will move our
infrastructure off of Oracle-owned and hosted servers, and we will rename
existing independent components of the infrastructure to no longer use "Hudson"
- i.e., mailing lists, Github repos, etc. This would be a gradual process,
obviously.</p>

<p>Third, we will put in place an interim governance board for the project,
consisting of three members - myself, Kohsuke and, if Oracle elects to remain
involved, Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer working on Hudson. The interim
board members will serve for the next 3-6 months, until the governance
structure can be nailed down securely enough to hold elections for the board
members.</p>

<p>Obviously, such a move could not be undertaken without the agreement and
support of the Hudson community. We believe this proposal is the best choice
for the project in the situation it's currently in, but we aren't closing off
discussion, questions, etc, and we encourage your feedback and comments. If
there's anything you need clarified, please ask and we'll do our best to
answer.</p>

<p>Once Oracle's proposal is available later this week (hopefully Wednesday,
possibly Thursday, from what I've been told), which I strongly advise you all to 
read and consider, we'll be putting up a poll to determine the position of the 
community. Once that vote is done, assuming the consensus is to rename, we'll 
put the mechanisms in motion and switch over as fast we can.</p>

<p>There may be some confusion as to whether we're proposing to fork Hudson, or
rename the existing project. I firmly believe we are proposing the latter - for
me, the project's key component is Kohsuke himself. If the community decides to
support renaming the project to Jenkins, and Oracle chooses to continue
development themselves under the name Hudson, they are, obviously, entirely
welcome to do so. But with Kohsuke working on Jenkins, that's the true home and
the future of the project for me, regardless of the name.</p>
