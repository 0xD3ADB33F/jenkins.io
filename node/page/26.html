What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation
virtually any project

Community-contributed localizations to be bundled in Jenkins 1.443
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Brueghel-tower-of-babel.jpg/350px-Brueghel-tower-of-babel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:1em; height:100px"></a><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In 1.430, we added <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin">the translation assistance plugin</a> in the hope of increasing the contribution from the community. It's been 3 months, and I've finally took the opportunity to integrate them into Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The result is pretty amazing. Before this, we had 26 languages, with wildly varying degree of completeness, such as French, Japanese, German, etc. This is still pretty good, but this integration added updates to 40 languages, including 17 brand-new languages, pushing the total up to whopping 43 languages. Among the newly added languages are Arabic (sorry, no right-to-left support yet), Esperanto, Hebrew, as well as large amount of Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and Korean.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While working with this, I've also discovered an issue that prevented Jenkins from correctly showing Hebrew, Indonesian, and Yedish localizations. All these changes will be in 1.443. And going forward, I'll be integrating changes more frequently to reduce the delay.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So big thank you for everyone who contributed localizations, and please keep them coming! <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin">Contributing localization is very easy</a>. If you are interested in more seriously working on localizations, please see <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Internationalization#Internationalization-Whattranslatorsneedtoknow%2Fdo">this Wiki page</a> and request the committership in the project. This is yet another way people can contribute to OSS without writing code.

The beginning of a new era: Ruby plugins now a reality
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jruby.png" align="right" width="180" alt="Yay JRuby!" /> It's not often that I get to use <em>that</em> much hyperbole in a Jenkins blog post, but I think in this case it's allowable. A journey that started over a year ago by <a href="https://twitter.com/cowboyd">Charles Lowell</a> has reached a new level, thanks to lots of help from <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> along with <a href="https://twitter.com/nahi">Hiroshi Nakamura</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jorgenpt">Jørgen Tjernø</a>.</p>

<p>As of today, with Jenkins 1.438, you can now <strong>download and install Ruby plugins from the update center</strong> (the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pathignore+Plugin">Path Ignore plugin</a> being the first).</p>

<p>Words simply can't express what a monumental achievement this is for the Jenkins project, both from the technical perspective but also in terms of what this means for the future of the project.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/languages">languages dashboard on GitHub</a>, Ruby is over two times as popular as Java on the site. I do not intend to start a language popularity contest here, but if we pretend just for a minute that the GitHub ecosystem is all that exists. Can you then imagine how powerful it would be to engage and include a community of open source developers that would be two times the size of the current pool of contributors? That's <strong>tremendous</strong> potential!</p>

<h3 id="great-where-do-i-start">Great! Where do I start?</h3>

<p>For those that are curious, the first officially released Ruby plugin for Jenkins is Jørgen's <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/pathignore-plugin">pathignore-plugin</a> which can be found in the update center. If you're looking for a reference project, this is currently the most up-to-date plugin.</p>

<p>There is also a <strong><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby">wiki page covering Ruby plugin development</a></strong>, which might be a little out-of-date but covers most of the essentials.</p>

<p>Additionally you might find the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-prototype-ruby-plugin">jenkins-prototype-plugin</a> an interesting resource as it is practically a kitchen sink of demo/test Ruby plugin code.</p>

<p>Currently only a few extension points (BuildStep, Publisher, BuildWrapper) are mapped in a Ruby-friendly manner. Don't let that scare you though! If you dig around in the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugin-runtime">jenkins-plugin-runtime</a> you can see how the existing extension points are mapped from Java into Ruby, because Ruby plugins are running under JRuby, if you need to access some Java APIs, you can do so without too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="the-thank-yous">The Thank Yous</h3>

<p>Great efforts like this one don't just happen without support, which is why I'd like to call out and thank <a href="http://thefrontside.net/">The FrontSide</a> for their <strong>wonderful</strong> support, helping to cover costs of WebEx for Office Hours and covering Charles' time while he worked with Kohsuke on the internal plumbing needed to make Ruby plugins possible within Jenkins core. If the name "The FrontSide" looks familiar to you, that might be because they also created and donated the Jenkins logo!</p>

<p>We should also thank <a href="http://www.mylookout.com">Lookout, Inc</a> (<em>full disclosure: Lookout is my employer</em>) and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> for affording some employee time for Jørgen and Kohsuke respectively to work on the project.</p>

<p><img src="/sites/default/files/images/headshot.png" align="right" />It is just turning into a video heavy week isn't it? First the <a href="/content/jenkins-meetup-munich-videos">videos from the Munich Meetup</a> were made available, and now the videos from the <em>first</em> ever <a href="/content/jenkins-user-conference">Jenkins User Conference</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of slides and videos can be found <strong><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb">on this page</a></strong>, hosted by <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> who  did a phenomenal job helping to organize and host the conference.</p>

<p>I want to thank everybody else involved once again, the fantastic speakers, the enthusiastic attendees and of course the sponsors for making it possible (CloudBees, Red Hat, LifeRay, New Relic, Sauce Labs, Chariot Solutions and eXo).</p>

<p>Better late than never right? Back in June, during his world tour, <a href="https://twitter.com/abayer">Andrew Bayer</a> stopped by Munich to participate in a Jenkins Meetup along with Dr. Ullrich Hafner.</p>

<p>Andrew gave a talk titled "The State of Jenkins" (<a href="http://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/The_State_of_Jenkins.pdf">slides</a>) and Ullrich talked about "Static Code Analysis with Jenkins" (<a href="http://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/Static_Code_Analysis_With_Jenkins.pdf">slides</a>)</p>

As if <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/report-bugs-and-win-kindle">getting a Kindle for reporting bugs</a> and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-community-survey">getting an AppleTV for filing a survey</a> aren't enough, you can also <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-community-contests.cb#bugbounty">win an iPad for fixing an issue</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So if you've been thinking about tinkering with <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Repositories">Jenkins code base</a> but haven't done so yet, this is a great opportunity to get going. There's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins">documentation about how to get started</a>, and there's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">Jenkins Office Hours</a> and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">IRC channel</a> if you need some interactive help from existing devs. I think new features, not just bug fixes, would qualify, so long as it's recorded in the issue tracker. And similarly, I think the plugins would qualify, not just core. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Aside from iPad, there's one $50 Amazon gift certificate going out every week, which is almost a steal! So be sure to submit your entry!<br/>

There's currently <a href="http://bit.ly/rYnFy2">a survey running</a> to get a better sense of our use base. Those inputs help us steer the effort wisely, so we appreciate your taking time to fill it in. The result would be more useful if larger number of people participate, so feel free to encourage others to fill it in as well.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In the same spirit of the fundraising drive in NPR, CloudBees is throwing in a "thank you gift" of AppleTV as an added incentive. See <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/11/take-jenkins-survey.html">their blog post</a> for more details.
