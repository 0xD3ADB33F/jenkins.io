One month of Continuous Blog
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>It's been a little over a month since I pinged Kohsuke about an "official Hudson blog"; my role has been nothing more than writer and editor of a community resource, while I have invested a lot of time in Continuous Blog it is not "mine" so much as it is "ours." I feel I have a responsibility as the current maintainer of this resource to be as open as possible about what's going on with CB. When I sat down to write the inaugural post, <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/welcome-continuous-blog">Welcome to Continuous Blog</a>, I set forth a few goals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community</li>
    <li>Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels</li>
    <li>Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog's traffic, then I'll get to reviewing the goals.</p>

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/cb_visits.png" width="550" />
<em>Visitor trend via Google Analytics</em></p>

<p>Over the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from a number of different sources, the top sources being:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a> links posted to <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a></li>
  <li>Direct visits</li>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a></li>
  <li>Referrals from the "blog" link on <a href="http://hudson-ci.org">hudson-ci.org</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/domain/hudson-ci.org">reddit</a></li>
  <li>Links from the <a href="http://java.net">Java.net</a> community portal and associated weblogs</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS subscribers.</p>

<p>To put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173 different developers and the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account has about 1,100 followers.</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
### Hudson Advocacy
Looking at the traffic sources and the volume of traffic coming from what I would consider "the wider internet community" I'd say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic seems to be coming from "within the community", which is certainly not a bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links to Continuous Blog and the content isn't "interesting" enough to come up in searches for terms like "continuous integration with python".</p>

<p>The vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney's post on <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/keeping-your-configuration-and-data-subversion">Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion</a> was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the past month. I'll be reaching out to more power-users from differing backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python, Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2 pros about guides.</p>

<h3 id="central-information-repository">Central information repository</h3>
<p>I feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we've been able to aggregate is small, but growing.</p>

<p>I have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases, but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time doing.</p>

<h3 id="recognition-of-contributors">Recognition of contributors</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this goal I've met. When writing up each Hudson release I've made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that contributed, Through the "spotlight" series of posts I've also made an effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately I've done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin developers, something I'm still not certain how to correct.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>If you've been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>"This Week in Plugins"
    <ul>
      <li>This post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an informative listing of "what's happening" in plugin development for the past week.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Spotlight On"
    <ul>
      <li>The only interview-formatted series I've got going right now, I've been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson in interesting ways and are willing to let "us" peek behind the curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it's fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hudson 1.xxx Released
    <ul>
      <li>Pretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or editorializing on what's gone into the release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Links for
    <ul>
      <li>Roll-up of links shared or retweeted via the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My two questions to the community in general would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you dislike any of these?</li>
  <li>What else would you like to see on a regular basis?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm certainly open to suggestion, I'd like Continuous Blog to continue to be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest challenge of Continuous Blog is <strong>time</strong>. As it stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn't maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=muni+hits+pedestrian">not uncommon around here</a>), this blog would go dark for a while.</p>

<p>This can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog, I'll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.</p>

<hr />

<p>All said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and following the Hudson community. I'm grateful for all those who've asked questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out for the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co">meet-up in mid-March</a>, for the rest of you, I'll catch you on IRC :)</p>

Meet-up and Hack alongside Kohsuke and Co.
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Ever wanted to pick the brains of <strong>multiple</strong> Hudson developers and users, all at the same time? Feel like finally meeting Kohsuke in person? Now's your chance!</p>

<p>We're hosting our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0">second-ever Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup</a> on <strong>March 19th and 20th</strong>. That's nearly <em>two</em> whole days of Hudson!</p>

<h3 id="day-one-mar-19">Day One (Mar. 19)</h3>
<p>The first day of the hackathon/meetup is aimed primarily at those working with Hudson's core, or are building on top of Hudson (plugins, etc).</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
  <li><em>End:</em>   5 p.m.</li>
  <li><em>Location:</em> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SunSantaClaraCampus">Oracle Santa Clara campus</a> in the "library" conference room of SCA7 "Mansion" building.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will a number of community and corporate Hudson hackers joining us on Friday, so bring everything you'll need to get some grade A hacking done with Kohsuke, Andrew Bayer, Alan Harder and your fellow plugin hackers.</p>

<h3 id="day-two-mar-20">Day Two (Mar. 20)</h3>
<p>I'm tentatively calling this the <strong>main event</strong>, which will be hosted at the delightful <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com">Hacker Dojo</a> in Mountain View. The "main event" will carry over the hackathon from the day before at Oracle, into a full blown community hackathon and meet-up. This is for Hudson <strong>hackers and users</strong> alike!</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
  <li><em>End:</em>   6 p.m.</li>
  <li><em>Location:</em> <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com/">Hacker Dojo</a> (Savanna room)</li>
</ul>

<p>As I've <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon">pointed out before</a>, Hudson's getting a lot of attention in other developer circles such as the Python, Ruby, Cocoa communities. As such, I'm hoping to get a lot of folks interested in using Hudson to come to Hacker Dojo where we (already being Hudson users) can help get them up to speed with all the great things Hudson can do.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>If you're interested please RSVP:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Via the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0">hackathon page on the wiki</a></li>
  <li>Via Facebook for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=369652692847">day one</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=359578281880">day two</a></li>

### How you can help
While I casually refer to myself as a "PR intern" for <a id="aptureLink_8uglegfosn" href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>, I'm technically a busy software engineer, meaning I'm grateful for all the help I can get.</p>

<h5 id="get-the-word-out">Get the word out</h5>
<p>The best way to help get the word out is to talk about Hudson and the meetup, this includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Link to this post on Twitter</li>
  <li>Ping any user groups you are a member of in the area</li>
  <li>Blog about it</li>
  <li>Let your co-workers know about it</li>
  <li>Attend!</li>
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
##### Volunteer to help setup/teardown
Hosting the Saturday event at Hacker Dojo does carry some responsibilities with it. We will need some extra hands to make sure everybody has power, refreshments are chilled, lunch is ordered and delivered, and of course, cleaning up after we leave. If you're in a generous mood, or in a real need for some karma, sign up to help on <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0">the bottom of the wiki page</a></p>

<p>I am hoping Oracle and some other heavy users/contributors will kick in a few bucks for lunch and drinks on Saturday, if you think your company can help us out, feel free to ping me directly at <code>tyler</code> at <code>linux.com</code>.</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/03/08/hudson-1-349-released/'>
Hudson 1.349 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Last Friday, March 5th, Hudson 1.349 was pushed out into the wild with an even split of bug fixes and enhancements. Included in this release is Alan Harder's (a.k.a <code>mindless</code>) old data monitor code, discussed previously in the post "<a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/call-testers-older-better">Call for Testers: The older the better</a>." Included in this release were further updates to the japanese and german localizations of Hudson; if you're interested in helping localize Hudson into more languages you can join the effort via the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Internationalization">Internationalization page on the wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Now for the breakdown of the 1.349 release:</p>

<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fix deserialization problem with fields containing double underscore.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5768">issue 5768</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fix deserialization problem for Exception objects where the XML has bad/old data.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5769">issue 5769</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fix serialization problem with empty CopyOnWriteMap.Tree.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5776">issue 5776</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt; 
    Fixed a bug that can cause 404 in the form validation check.
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Enhancements</p>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Remote build result submission shouldn't hang forever even if Hudson goes down.
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Added a monitor for old or unreadable data in XML files and a manage screen to assist
    in updating files to the current data format and/or removing unreadable data from plugins
    that are no longer active.  "Manage Hudson" page will show a link if any old/unreadable
    data was detected.
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Added a mechanism to bundle <tt>init.groovy</tt> inside the war for OEM.
    (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/preconfigured-hudson-war-tp1575216p1575216.html">report</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt; 
    Added an extension point to annotate console output.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2137">issue 2137</a>)</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Contributors
Hudson 1.349 contains <strong>43</strong> commits from 6 contributors, due to the merging in of Alan Harder's old-data-monitor branch the commit count is a bit off from the amount of code change that actually went out in 1.349.</p>

Tag team: Automating massive projects with Hudson and Artifactory
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>For those of you living in or around Silicon Valley, next Wednesday (March 10th) you might want to reserve some space around 6pm on your calendar. <a id="aptureLink_K4R8mjN6aN" href="http://freddy33.blogspot.com/">Frederic Simon</a> and <a id="aptureLink_j4VWwlQ9I2" href="http://twitter.com/yoavlandman">Yoav Landman</a> from <a id="aptureLink_gvHDYIidrI" href="http://twitter.com/artifrog">JFrog</a> will be presenting at the <a href="http://www.svjugfx.org/">Silicon Valley JavaFX Users Group</a> meeting at the Googleplex. Frederic and Yoav will be discussing and demonstrating how JFrog's Artifactory works with Hudson to combine continuous integration with release management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Join with the Artifactory team to realize the benefits of managing your software development life-cycle through continuous integration.</p>

  <p>Frederic Simon (JFrog Chief Architect) and Yoav Landman (JFrog CTO) will demonstrate how to automate large-scale multi-module projects, using a fully-integrated platform with Artifactory and Hudson.</p>

  <p>Using Maven, Gradle or Ivy builds, it is now possible to dynamically automate and manage the pyramidal stacks of Unit, Functional, and Integration Tests.</p>

  <p>This demo-based session will show you how Artifactory and Hudson together make it much easier to promote certified builds to milestone releases , and finally to general availability, while making sure all builds are fully reproducible.</p>

  <p>Staying dynamic all through the development process avoids code freeze and provides very accurate feedback loops. This is crucial for Developers, QA teams, System and Integration testers, Users, Customers, and all the remaining actors of the development process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're interested in attending, you can RSVP on <a href="http://www.svjugfx.org/calendar/12559455/?eventId=12559455&amp;action=detail">the meetup page</a></p>

<p>Since I've been a bit pre-occupied with non-Hudson related activities lately, I have missed a few days of link rollups, I suppose it's fitting to get a couple days worth of links in one post.</p>

<p>While The Build Doctor has the time to follow the continuous integration world and post links on a daily basis, I haven't found the same quantity of Hudson links on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, I will be posting a link-rollup every few days. Do let me know if this is too infrequent. That said, here's some interesting links!</p>

What new features do you want to see?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Michael Donohue, a Hudson developer who has taken on the role of master bug triage guy for Hudson, does something regularly which I've really come to appreciate as a Hudson developer myself: he sends out emails to the dev list with the top 10 voted issues at that time. This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what's really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you're interested, you can see <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10045">the top voted issues</a> over at <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">our JIRA server.</a></p>

<p>A good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I'm actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-682">HUDSON-682</a>, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I'm sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren't on that list. So I'm asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn't already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one's yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.</p>

<p>Or, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong>  If you're interested in writing a plugin, you can check out <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">Hudson's wiki</a> and/or <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugin+tutorial">this guide</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>Andrew Bayer (<code>abayer</code>) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson's core and a small number of other plugins. Andrew also helps Kohsuke with a lot of Hudson's project infrastructure, most notably the migration from Bugzilla on Java.net to JIRA running at <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a>.</p>
