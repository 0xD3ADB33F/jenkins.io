Live Blog: Kohsuke's Presentation at JavaOne
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> <em>This is a <strong>very</strong> rough set of notes from <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi's</a> presentation at JavaOne 2010.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudsonlabs/5008629375/" title="Kohsuke talks to a packed room at #JavaOne by hudson.labs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5008629375_6f603b6093_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Kohsuke talks to a packed room at #JavaOne" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Kohsuke takes the stage, asks "who uses's Hudson" the majority of
audience raises their hands</p>

<p>Discussing the great ecosystem using Hudson across the wide-variety of platforms/languages.
330+ community written plugins. Last year at JavaOne we had 230+ plugins</p>

<p>Eclipse Community Survey, Hudson adoption from 9.1% in 2009 to 21.8%</p>

<p>Discussing Hudson adoption, going over Hudson job postings on indeed.com going up compared to a stagnant Cruise Control.</p>

<p>Kohsuke introduces himself and InfraDNA, started Hudson in 2004/2005.</p>

<p>First steps to CI, 10,000 foot overview of SCM monitoring/build/testing. Delving into using Hudson
for automating <strong>everything</strong> to get "more out of your Hudson deployment.</p>

<h3 id="interconnecting-jobs-aka-workflows">"Interconnecting Jobs aka Workflows"</h3>

<p>Hudson allows for hosting many projects on one Hudson deployment, meaning you need a smaller number of administrators for a larger number of jobs compared to Cruise Control.</p>

<p>Building Block #1: Triggering. Using "upstream" and "downstream" jobs ot interconnect jobs to form a workflow in Hudosn. Triggering is asynchronoys in Hudson, useful for separating builds and multiple test jobs. Splitting the build and test jobs so you build quickly test many tests in parallel.</p>

<p>Avoid recompiling compilation/builds in the "downstream" test runs. "Copy Artifact" plugin very useful for passing built executables to test jobs.</p>

<p>Upstream/downstream separation also highly useful for separating build and deployment into a continuous workflow.</p>

<p>Building Block #2: Join plugin. Fan downstream jobs out and then bring everything back together for final
steps.</p>

<p>Shows Join plugin configuration screen because "perhaps the configuration is a little unintuitive".</p>

<p>Building block #3: Fingerprints. Using MD5 checksums from artifacts to learn more about those artifacts in your
Hudson, tying together artifacts from different jobs/builds. Letting Hudson recording these fingerprints of those artifacts in your lifecycle allows Hudson to help you find out where/when those executables came from.</p>

<p>Fingerprinting mechanism good for tracking dependencies from third parties, Hudson uses 3rd party fingerprints to compute additional information. Also useful for aggregating reports.</p>

<p>Going a bit further using the "build promotion plugin" to weed out which builds are "better than others." Taking fingerprints from a build job all the way through the life cycle and passing that fingerprint around test/smoke test jobs, if that passes, build passes on to more rigorous testing, only if it's passed base-level testing. Basic model of promotion maps to a "confidence level", 1st level passes compilation, 2nd level passes smoke test, 3rd level passes expensive/time-consuming tests.</p>

<p>One of the reasons to use promotion in your lifecycle to ensure that artifacts meet a minimum "confidence level" so you're not expending resources running the longer tests )think about a promotion hierarchy)</p>

<p><strong>Demo time!</strong></p>

<p>Kohsuke demoing build promotion live with fingerprinting of sample jar files. Creating a "component-X" build and a "test-X" build. test-X job using the "Copy Artifact" plugin to grab artifacts from the component-X build.</p>

<p>Defining the promotion criteria in "component-X", "test-X" promoted, indicates that certain builds promoted a build.</p>

<p><strong>End demo time!</strong></p>

<h3 id="maven-integration">Maven Integration</h3>

<p>Maven integration highlights. Going over POM comprehension and simplified configuration due to more information
getting inferred from the POMs. Building dependency chains with Maven integration.</p>

<p>"That's the basics, let's talk about advanced integration with Maven"</p>

<p>Parallel-module builds! Letting Hudson builds modules with a single checkbox, meaning wherever possible Hudson will try to build your modules in parallel when possible.</p>

<p>Incremental builds! Only building changed modules in a build run to be more efficient, preventing the need to rebuild the whole project from scratch every time. Hudson's SCM integration to determine what the mapping between files changed and modules needing to be built.</p>

<p>Private Maven repositories! Avoiding artifacts being overwritten by others, telling Hudson to create a Maven repository <strong>per-project</strong> (at the expense of more bandwidth/disk space needed), helps segregate builds to avoid them stomping on each other.</p>

<p>After-the-fact deployment, avoiding deploying modules unless the whole build is successful (all modules properly built). Instead of using <code>mvn deploy</code>, you tell Hudson to deploy to your Maven repository with a single checkbox.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-project">Matrix Project</h3>

<p>No longer alpha! Production-ready!</p>

<p>Often used to build/test across slight variations of build environments such as different platforms for a C++ project. Conceptually it's like running your build in a for loop.</p>

<p>Hudson supports a number of different axes, most popular of which being a "slave axis" which allows you to use different labels or specific slaves for the build. Hudson also supports arbirtrary text fields as axes to be passed along to the build steps as environment variables.</p>

<p>Touching on "filtering" in the matrix project support to remove parts of an axis that you do not need. I.e if you have a "platform" and a "browser" axes for web testing, you can exclude the "iexplore" value of the "browser" axis when the "platform" axis is "mac".</p>

<p><strong>Demo time!</strong></p>

<p>Defining two axes, "slave" axis and the "JDK" axis to build against different JDK versions on linux, solaris and windows. Excluding "touchstone builds" to avoid rebuilding a large number of matrix builds unless a limited subset of the combinations successfully build. Used to avoid spending a lot of time spinning cycles on very obvious errors that the first few builds "recognize" immediately.</p>

<p><strong>End demo time</strong></p>

<h3 id="doing-selenium-testing-on-hudson">Doing Selenium testing on Hudson</h3>

<p>Use "Selenium Grid plugin" to install Selenium binaries on all slaves and prepares them all to talk to each other. Useful for "overloading" an existing Hudson cluster as a Selenium cluster.</p>

<p>Using labels in Hudson to better determine which node has which browser.</p>

<p>Selenium integration is <strong>very</strong> powerful when combined with the join plugin and the matrix configuration support in Hudson for web testing across a large number of platforms and browsers.</p>

<p>The Hudson project has invested heavily in getting great cluster support which helps tremendously with Selenium which has invested as heavily in clustering.</p>

<p>How to you deal with Selenium needing a GUI while Hudson slaves are largely headless. Use the Xvnc plugin! On Windows things are bit trickier, easier to let Hudson slave/service "interact with desktop" such that it can access dialogs/etc. Failing everything else, configuring Windows for auto-login and then have JNLP slaves autostart at login will work for allowing the slave to use the GUI and network resources.</p>

<p>The rest of the session was dedicated to some good Q&amp;A. Great session by Hudson's founder.</p>

JavaOne taking shape
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Last night on my way out of San Francisco I stopped by 4th and Howard St to get my first taste of JavaOne/Oracle OpenWorld which was already taking shape at the location. Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red "security" jacket; suffice to say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected!</p>

<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4997929716/" title="Oracle taking over Howard St by agentdero, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4997929716_1675745efe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Oracle taking over Howard St" /></a></center>

<p>Unlike last year's Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens, this event will be crammed together with JavaOne. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4998934102/" title="20100917_003.jpg by agentdero, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4998934102_d7c71e575e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="20100917_003.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" /></a></p>

<p>At this point I'm not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion of the event goes, we do have <strong>two</strong> Hudson related events scheduled:
<!--break-->
<br clear="all" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Getting More Out of Your Hudson</strong> - Monday at 10:00 a.m. - Hosted by our very own <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>, the session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.</li>
  <li><strong>Getting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next Level</strong> - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous <a href="http://twitter.com/wakeleo">John Smart</a> the session will also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.</li>
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4998330661/" title="20100917_004.jpg by agentdero, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4998330661_91514f797a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="20100917_004.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I could find, as <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">Andrew Bayer</a> has <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer/status/24507253586">mentioned before</a>, finding a proper schedule is near impossible. While at JavaOne, I intend on posting updates, pictures and maybe a little scathing commentary (they did give me a blogger pass for some silly reason).</p>

<p>If you're going to be at JavaOne, <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/lets-talk-about-hudson-javaone">think about coming and talking to me</a> about how you/your company uses Hudson. I might just have stickers!</p>

<p><br clear="all" /></p>

Let's talk about Hudson at JavaOne
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>A few months ago I enjoyed running a couple <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/views/interviews">interviews with folks</a> who were using Hudson but lately I've lacked the time and coffee to get more interviews done. <img src="http://www.hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/taperecorder.jpg" alt="Interview time!" align="right" hspace="10" /></p>

<p>I am planning on making up for it by bringing my fancy smancy tape recorder (i.e. a smartphone) and a few notepads to the upcoming <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html">JavaOne conference</a> here in San Francisco.</p>

<p>If you're interested in talking to me about how you or your company uses Hudson in your quest for world domination, you will be able to find me at the <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup">Hudson hackathon</a> on Sunday the 19th, or at JavaOne on Monday, Tuesday and <em>maybe</em> Wednesday.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop me a line at tyler[at]linux.com and we'll set something up!</p>

<p>Last time I <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/hudsonmobi-20-hits-android-market">talked about HudsonMobi 2.0</a> there were some hiccups with the QR code which <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/21335228733">made me pretty irritated</a>. Now the leading mobile app for Hudson users has regained my trust with their <a href="http://hudsonmobi.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/hudsonmobi-for-ios-4-is-here/">lastest release for iOS 4</a>, the latest incarnation of Apple's mobile operating systems for iPhones and iPod Touches.</p>

<p>Since I fall into the category of subhumans who for one reason or another choose not to own an iPhone, I can't verify the awesomeness of this new HudsonMobi release. If it is anything like the 2.0 release for Android you can expect enhancements such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tighter integration with iOS 4</li>
  <li><strong>Embedded artifact viewer!</strong> For archived build artifacts that are text-based, you can view them directly on your handset.</li>
  <li>Access to the build history and changes for a job.</li>
  <li>Quick and easy access to a job's last build</li>
</ul>

<p>If you own a device with iOS <strong>3.0 or higher</strong> you should be able to download HudsonMobi 2.0 from the appstore, if you give it a whirl, please leave a comment to let me know how awesome it is :)</p>

<p>Just wanted to let everybody know that I've gone ahead and added a <a href="/calendar">Calendar</a> for all the upcoming Hudson-related events.</p>

<p>Hopefully we'll be able to add more and more events for the rest of the year including seminars, more meetups and potentially a few drink-ups!</p>

<p>Worth mentioning that I've not yet tested the iCal feed so if you have troubles with it, let me know (via the comments).</p>

Recent label and matrix project improvement
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Today, I’d highlight two recent improvements to the label and matrix projects.</p>

<p>When you have multiple slaves in your Hudson build farm, you can use labels to classify slaves by their capability/environment/architecture/etc. For example, your one slave might have “32bit” and “windows” label, while another one might have “linux”, “ubuntu”, and “64bit.” (with plugins like &lt;a href=”http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/PlatformLabeler+Plugin”&gt;platform-labeler plugin&lt;/a&gt;, you can attach labels automatically, too.) Or if you do Selenium testing, you might add browser names as labels to indicate which slave has which browser available.</p>

<p>With such set up, you then specify that such and such jobs can be only run on such and such labels. For example, you might say your “test-foo” job requires the “windows” label, while your “compile-bar” job might require the “macos” label.
<!--break-->
Starting 1.372, Hudson now lets you use boolean expressions here, instead of just specifying one label as the requirement. For example, your “seleniumTest-zot” job can now say it requires “windows&amp;&amp;firefox” since it’s meant to run on Windows with Firefox. Or if your job requires a shell script, you might say “!windows” to indicate that it has to be run somewhere that’s not Windows.</p>

<p>Labels are also often used in the context of the multi-configuration project (a.k.a. matrix project.) In a multi-configuration project, you specify what to execute to build your project, then specify a number of “axes” that represents the variable and their possible values to execute a build. There are several different kinds of axes (and this is of course extensible), and one of them is the label axis.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a test suite that you want to run on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, to make sure it works correctly under all these environments. In such a case, you define one label axis, and tell Hudson that you have three possible values “windows”, “linux”, and “solaris.” When you build this project, Hudson will run your build three times by finding appropriate slave that carries the specified label.</p>

<p>In 1.373, you can now specify multiple label axes. For example, you might have a C++ project that needs to be compiled on various platforms. In such a case, you can define one label axis to be “windows”, “linux”, “solaris”, and you can define another label axis to be “32bit” and “64bit”. This will generate 3x2=6 combinations to be executed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the exhaustive combinations do not make sense. In such a case, you can use a filter boolean expression to eliminate some values. You can also use the same mechanism to create a sparse matrix — that is, you tell Hudson to reduce the coverage to 33%, and Hudson will eliminate every 2 out of 3 combinations.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> for sponsoring this work, which made it possible for <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> to provide this feature to the community. People often think that contributing code is the only way to give back to the project, but sponsoring features like this is another great way to do it.</p>

<p><br/>
The current tentative plan is to do a short "state of the union / what's new" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&amp;A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.<br/>
<br/>

Hudson at JavaZone, Meetup in Oslo 
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://jz10.java.no/">JavaZone</a> is a big Java conference in Scandinavia, and Hudson is well represented there. On September 8th, Håkon Snøtun will be presenting "Top 5 plugins for Hudson and Chuck Norris." and on September 9th, I'll be presenting "Getting more out of your Hudson."<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
But more importantly, what is a conference without drinking!? So in that spirit, <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a> will be organizing a Hudson User Meetup at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Oslo&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Oslo,+Norway&ll=59.912614,10.743604&spn=0.001589,0.004823&t=h&z=18">The Scotsman</a> from Sep 8th 19:30 (<a href="http://www.scotsman.no/">website</a>.) We'll get together, have some drinks, and enjoy geeky conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So if you are local or visiting Oslo for JavaZone, come join us. If you plan to join us at The Scotsman, please <a href="mailto:kohsuke@infradna.com">RSVP</a>, and watch out for <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">my twitter updates</a> for any last minute time/location changes.<br/>
