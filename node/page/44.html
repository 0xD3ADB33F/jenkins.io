Spotlight on: SpringSource
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>For this week's user spotlight segment, I'm talking with <a id="aptureLink_FPwIok2zLS" href="http://twitter.com/dougmaceachern">Doug MacEachern</a> of <a id="aptureLink_3sE4QkWryf" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/hyperic">Hyperic</a>, part of <a id="aptureLink_Xv7fvWA2ED" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/springsource">SpringSource</a>, a division of VMware, hoping I got that dependency chain correct. Hyperic builds enterprise systems monitoring and management software and also contributes to a number of open source projects, many of which are built with Hudson. <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/sites/default/files/hyperic_hudson.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/sites/default/files/hyperic_hudson.png" align="right" width="350" alt="A small subsection of Hyperic's Hudson" /></a></p>

<p>To date I must say that Doug's use of Hudson is one of the largest and more impressive installations I've seen. I don't want to spoil the interview, but they're testing on platforms that don't even run <em>Java</em>. Madness! If you think you can out-do him, you can find my email information at the bottom of the interview, I'd love to hear about it!</p>

<p>Without further ado, Doug from SpringSource.

We started using Hudson in early 2008 to automate the build and testing of our <a href="http://sigar.hyperic.com/">SIGAR library</a>.  The SIGAR API implements a portable interface in C for gathering system information related to memory, processors, file systems, network interfaces, network connection tables, the process table and more.  We support dozens of OS + version + architecture combinations, along with several language bindings.  SIGAR is a key component of the Hyperic HQ agent and is used in other projects including <a id="aptureLink_WX9L4DHx0m" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertable">Hypertable</a>, <a id="aptureLink_Fy6elgHTOH" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/terracota">Terracotta</a>, <a id="aptureLink_RhcetOJ6YC" href="http://www.gridgain.com/">GridGain</a> and MySQL enterprise.

</td><td>The SIGAR project actually started back in late 2002 and our initial CI system for the project was a good old-fashioned Perl script / ssh for-loop.  It was good enough to get by in the early years, but a proper replacement was long overdue.  We were (and still are) using <a id="aptureLink_koprNR3BrL" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a> to build and test Hyperic HQ.  We looked at using Bamboo for SIGAR, but at the time the "Remote Agent" feature was new to Bamboo and was not in the version we were running. Rather than disrupt HQ's CI along with taking on an additional licensing cost, we gave Hudson a shot and haven't looked back.

Checking out the <a href="http://hudson.hyperic.com">public Hudson server</a>, I see that SpringSource is building/testing products on AIX, the BSDs, various flavors of Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X, what kinds of languages/build systems are being built by Hudson? How varied are the environments that Hudson executes jobs in?

And HP-UX! The matrix of SIGAR's supported OS + kernel version + architecture + distribution is north of 100 combinations.  So, Hudson is covering a very heterogeneous collection of systems with most jobs tied to a specific node.  Our primary focus has been the C API and Java JNI bindings, using an Ant based build system and a JUnit test suite.  SIGAR also has language bindings for Perl, Ruby, Python, Erlang, PHP, C# and Lua.  So, Hudson is also driving each language's extension build system of choice, respectively: MakeMaker, Rake, distutils, emake, phpize, Nant and autotools.

<p>The majority of our x86/x64 nodes are virtualized on VMware ESX and VMware Server.  We also have a fine collection of PPC, PA-RISC and Sparc hardware in house, with IA-64 and s390x hosted elsewhere by third parties.  Some of these systems are too old to support Java 1.5 and/or Git.  As a simple work-around, the nodes share an NFS workspace where the slave node takes care of 'SCM' and 'Post-build Actions', but the 'Build' step in between is invoked via ssh.
</p><p>
The SIGAR distribution includes about two dozen native binaries that are compatible with most of the supported platform matrix.  There's a Hudson job for each Git branch that rolls these binaries into a release bundle. Another job flavor uses the Hudson URL SCM plugin to download and unit test the binary releases on the rest of the platform matrix.  This is key to testing binary compatibility.  Similar for the <a href="http://collectd.org">collectd</a> project, each Git branch has a job that runs automake, autoconf, etc. and 'make dist' into the collectd release flavor tarball.  So a push to git.verplant.org by octo in Germany triggers an update of the collectd release artifact, which in turn triggers the URL SCM jobs to download the tarball, unpack and build over here at our west coast locations.
</p><p>
We have four Hudson servers in different locations, three of which are managing most of the jobs behind firewalls.  Select jobs use the Build Publisher plugin to post the job and its artifacts to our <a href="http://hudson.hyperic.com">public Hudson server</a>. This makes it easy for us to provide platform specific bug fixes in binary form, share build logs with external projects and host a central repository of artifacts reachable by all of the URL SCM based jobs. Our public Hudson server also provides CI for the HQApi project and jobs to build HQ plugins, again making it easier to distribute patch fixes in binary form between releases.

Other than some Hudson plugin tweaks and additions, the Perl script I mentioned earlier was converted to generate the majority of our Hudson jobs and includes a simple templating system.  The same script generates jobs to build collectd and a few other projects.  We've outgrown this flavor of the script and have started working on integrating <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef">Opscode Chef</a> to automate our Hudson configration along with the systems we build and test on. And of course, we're using Hyperic HQ to monitor our Hudson server instances, slaves and node machines.

It appears that SpringSource has bought in pretty deeply to a Hudson-oriented workflow, given the amount of time and resources you all have invested in getting the massive farm set up that you have. That said, on a scale from 1-10, how important would you rate Hudson to your day-to-day workflow?

<div class='content'>
<p>This past week <a id="aptureLink_z1tlMXupZM" href="http://twitter.com/pycon">PyCon</a> has been going on in Atlanta, where <a id="aptureLink_WLsRDsy9yw" href="http://twitter.com/ctitusbrown">Titus Brown</a> gave a talk titled:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why not run all your tests all the time? A study of continuous integration systems</p>
</blockquote>

<center><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just_use_hudson.png" alt="Just use Hudson" width="500" /></center>

<p>Titus has some notable quotes "just use Hudson" but overall a good introduction of CI and a breakdown of some of the challenges behind continuous integration. He also does a good job going over getting started with Hudson, setting up a basic Python project that incorporates JUnit XML reporting and slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Yeah, we used Buildbot until recently, then I switched us to Hudson and my life got a lot better"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're using Python with Hudson, I highly recommend watching the talk (embedded below).</p>

Would you run Hudson in the cloud?

</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>One of my favorite bloggers on the subject of continuous integration, <a id="aptureLink_e9BNkKIorq" href="http://twitter.com/builddoctor">The Build Doctor</a>, posed this question in <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/02/23/continuous-integration-in-the-cloud-good-idea/">a recent post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Continuous Integration in the cloud: good idea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The topic of running a CI server in a virtualized environment, such as with <a id="aptureLink_nJiKPqGQ1T" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon%20Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud">Amazon's EC2 service</a>, is an interesting issue, particularly in the Hudson community. About 10 months ago Kohsuke <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/18/hudson-ec2-plugin">announced the Hudson EC2 plugin</a> which has seen slow, but steady development since then, including support for the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/private">Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud</a> which was added to the plugin in a release last Monday.</p>

<p>As The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson <em>does</em> very effectively manage spinning slaves up and down on demand if you've configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to run a large farm of machines.<img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_in_the_cloud.png" align="right" /></p>

Hudson 1.347 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>The release of Hudson 1.347 last friday, February 19th, was a relatively "minor" one insofar that it contained an assortment of smaller fixes instead of fixes to major regressions (they weren't any to be fixed) or major features added. There were however some notable commits in this release cycle that didn't make the changelog just yet, for example <a id="aptureLink_TgMtrwa0Sz" href="http://twitter.com/_godin_">godin</a> committed an <a id="aptureLink_HxZkmWKjTi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebuild">ebuild</a> which will allow for a native package of Hudson for <a id="aptureLink_uU6StMFk4O" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo%20Linux">Gentoo Linux</a>, joining the ranks of the existing packages for Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, openSUSE and RedHat/Fedora Linux. The bundled Subversion plugin was updated and thanks to <a id="aptureLink_IPwBJtA60V" href="http://twitter.com/ssogabe">sogabe</a> and <a id="aptureLink_9NWuFKYOM9" href="http://twitter.com/wyukawa">wyukawa</a> the Japanese translations for Hudson got some updates as well.</p>

<p>For Hudson developers, both plugin and core, this release contains some notable changes from <a id="aptureLink_XwoYyUAc5v" href="http://blogs.sun.com/mindless">mindless</a> (a.k.a Alan Harder), a number of calls which have been deprecated for over <strong>two years</strong> have finally been pruned from the code base:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Hudson.addListener(JobListener)</code>, <code>Hudson.removeListener(JobListener)</code></li>
  <li>Entire <code>listeners.JobListener</code> class (replaced by <code>ItemListener</code>)</li>
  <li>One form of <code>DirectoryBrowser</code> constructor</li>
  <li>One form of <code>Descriptor.configure()</code> (with <code>HttpServletRequest</code> param)</li>
  <li><code>Descriptor.convert(Map)</code> and 4 implementations of this method, and code calling it in <code>Descriptor.readResolve()</code> (this code called <code>save()</code> whenever updating data, so there should be no remaining cases out there)</li>
</ul>

<p>Alan's quest for removing deprecated code will likely continue for a while, but this is a good step in the right direction, keeping Hudson's internals in good working order. Worth mentioning, the influx of plugin releases in the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/week-plugins-0">This Week in Plugins</a> from a couple weeks ago, was driven largely by Alan, rummaging through the code of older plugins, updating plugins left and right.
<!--break-->
Now the breakdown for this release:</p>

This Week in Plugins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Last week's TWIP enumerated the release of <strong>26</strong> different plugin, this past week has seen 19 unique releases in comparison. You might be tempted to assume that <em>less</em> plugin development has occurred over the past week, which isn't the case. Last week a number of the releases were "code updates", i.e. plugins being rebuilt against the latest Hudson plugin API as opposed to new features or bug-fixes. With the releases of plugins this past week, it seems a large number of the releases contained new features and bug fixes, including <strong>three new plugins!</strong></p>

<p>Making their Hudson debut are the following</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/System+Load+Average+Monitor+Plugin">Slave Monitor for system load average</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Tool+Environment+Plugin">Tool Environment plugin</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Ivy+Plugin">Ivy plugin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in contributing to an existing plugin, or building your own, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugin+tutorial">plugin tutorial</a> and joining the <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">dev@ mailing list</a>.

Spotlight on: VisFleet
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>For this week's user spotlight, I'm talking to Rasheed Abdul-Aziz of
VisFleet Ltd. out of New Zealand. This being our second "spotlight" on a particular company, the format can still be considered <em>beta</em>; if you have any additional questions for Rasheed, feel free to ask them in the comments and I'll try to get Rasheed to answer.</p>

<p>Similar to the spotlight on ITA Software from last week, VisFleet builds business software helping their customers operate their businesses more effectively through web applications in tandem with mobile applications. While I could endlessly discuss the power and flexibility of Hudson, particularly for building web software, I'll let Rasheed do the majority of the talking, so let's get to it.

Rasheed, thanks for talking with me today, I think I did a poor enough job
introducing <a id="aptureLink_qn9wDVslnL" href="http://twitter.com/visfleet">VisFleet</a>, would you mind explaining a bit more of what you guys do and some of the challenges it presents?

It's a pleasure. VisFleet has changed it's direction somewhat, moving from
services into product development. As we move into product, we want to be
responsive to our customers. Agile development is becoming core to how we
operate, and as such, continuous builds and integration became a major
factor. We now plan to offer two products for work planning and and vehicle
tracking. We want to present these systems with a SaaS model. The world of
online, pay as you go software, has a culture of frequent improvements and
responsiveness to user feedback. If we want to do well in this space, it's
important that we can code, test, release and feed back in
tight iterations.

We didn't actually, but certainly everyone I knew who was doing continuous

We build and test Ruby On Rails service layer applications. We also build <a id="aptureLink_hbiB8O3Dwj" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe%20Flex">Flex</a> applications using the Flex SDK for our web-deployed RIA offering. Lastly, we build our iPhone applications using Hudson.

I'd say building and testing web applications alone with Hudson would be quite notable, but to add Flex and iPhone applications into the mix as well is certainly interesting! Anything specific that's interesting about VisFleet's use of Hudson?

It runs multiple slave types, and automates deploys to different cloud
infrastructures. At the moment we have 2 Flex build slaves running Ubuntu, A
Mac Mini building our iPhone app, and several Ubuntu Servers testing our web
tier. We currently deploy to Citrix Xen servers, and soon to <a id="aptureLink_Xq08IAbEb1" href="http://twitter.com/RackCloud">Rackspace Cloud</a> as well.
<br />
<br />
In the near future, we will automate integration by first updating an
integration system on the cloud, deploying our system and then running our
tests. All very quickly.
<br />
<br />
We have very little metric and reporting output from Hudson, and this is
noteworthy in it's absence. It's very important  to use to provide clear
development metrics and integrate those into our <a id="aptureLink_ZAd2AShPj0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum%20%28development%29">Scrum</a>/<a id="aptureLink_U9x9KuaN08" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> approach. What
Hudson has done for us is educate us about the possibilities in
visualisation and reporting, and is informing the way we structure our
codebase going forward. Soon, we expect to have a premium test driven
development environment and workflow.
