<a href='/blog/2010/09/02/recent-label-and-matrix-project-improvement/'>
Recent label and matrix project improvement
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Today, I’d highlight two recent improvements to the label and matrix projects.</p>

<p>When you have multiple slaves in your Hudson build farm, you can use labels to classify slaves by their capability/environment/architecture/etc. For example, your one slave might have “32bit” and “windows” label, while another one might have “linux”, “ubuntu”, and “64bit.” (with plugins like &lt;a href=”http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/PlatformLabeler+Plugin”&gt;platform-labeler plugin&lt;/a&gt;, you can attach labels automatically, too.) Or if you do Selenium testing, you might add browser names as labels to indicate which slave has which browser available.</p>

<p>With such set up, you then specify that such and such jobs can be only run on such and such labels. For example, you might say your “test-foo” job requires the “windows” label, while your “compile-bar” job might require the “macos” label.
<!--break-->
Starting 1.372, Hudson now lets you use boolean expressions here, instead of just specifying one label as the requirement. For example, your “seleniumTest-zot” job can now say it requires “windows&amp;&amp;firefox” since it’s meant to run on Windows with Firefox. Or if your job requires a shell script, you might say “!windows” to indicate that it has to be run somewhere that’s not Windows.</p>

<p>Labels are also often used in the context of the multi-configuration project (a.k.a. matrix project.) In a multi-configuration project, you specify what to execute to build your project, then specify a number of “axes” that represents the variable and their possible values to execute a build. There are several different kinds of axes (and this is of course extensible), and one of them is the label axis.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a test suite that you want to run on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, to make sure it works correctly under all these environments. In such a case, you define one label axis, and tell Hudson that you have three possible values “windows”, “linux”, and “solaris.” When you build this project, Hudson will run your build three times by finding appropriate slave that carries the specified label.</p>

<p>In 1.373, you can now specify multiple label axes. For example, you might have a C++ project that needs to be compiled on various platforms. In such a case, you can define one label axis to be “windows”, “linux”, “solaris”, and you can define another label axis to be “32bit” and “64bit”. This will generate 3x2=6 combinations to be executed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the exhaustive combinations do not make sense. In such a case, you can use a filter boolean expression to eliminate some values. You can also use the same mechanism to create a sparse matrix — that is, you tell Hudson to reduce the coverage to 33%, and Hudson will eliminate every 2 out of 3 combinations.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> for sponsoring this work, which made it possible for <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> to provide this feature to the community. People often think that contributing code is the only way to give back to the project, but sponsoring features like this is another great way to do it.</p>

<p>As we near autumn up here in the Northern Hemisphere, the wind is starting to blow a bit chillier and here in the Bay Area that can only mean one thing: <strike>Oracle is suing everybody!</strike> it's time for JavaOne!</p>

<p>A whole lot has changed since last year, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, <a href="http://kohsuke.org/">Kohsuke</a> left Snoracle to found <a href="http://www.infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> and Hudson has continued to <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/cloudbees-announce-hudson-service">power on</a> as the single <strong>best</strong> continuous integration server on the planet.</p>

<p>While the tickets for Oracle OpenWorld/JavaOne are just as outrageously expensive as they were last year, we <strong>are</strong> hosting a meetup/hackathon/continuous-drinking-contest at <a href="http://about.digg.com/opensource">Digg</a> the Sunday prior. We have not yet set any kind of agenda, but some core Hudson hackers and plenty of plugin developers should be in town so it should be a great time hacking on and/or with Hudson.</p>

CloudBees announce Hudson-as-a-Service

<div class='content'>
<a href="http://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/usage-stats.gif"><img style="float:right; width:300px" src="http://hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/usage-stats.gif"></a><a href="http://cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> announced the beta availability of their new Hudson-as-a-service "HaaS" today. I see this as <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/08/12/welcome-hudson-to-creative-commons/">yet</a> <a href="http://hudson-mobi.com/">another</a> <a href="http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-technical-talks-kohsuke-kawaguchi">validation</a> to Hudson, and as such, I welcome this new addition to the community and wish them well! &mdash; more companies betting on Hudson means we'll get more investment to the project, which is all goodness for Hudson users. It's been 5 months since I left Oracle to start <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a>, and I was initially worried about a possible negative impact on adoption, but instead Hudson has shown with no sign of slowing down (see picture on the right, from Andrew's report, which shows # of estimated active installations that participates to our usage stats survey).  And <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a> is going well too - we've helped <a href="http://infradna.com/customers">companies big and small</a> to improve their Hudson usage/adoption, and <a href="http://infradna.com/ichci">our commercial value-add Hudson distribution</a> is getting plenty of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Hosted Hudson offers an interesting trade-off, compared to on-premise Hudson. On the plus side, given the current hourly pricing of public clouds like EC2 and Rackspace, you get a better pricing model, as CloudBees charge by minutes. You also get rid of machines and upfront cost, which is great for small business. On top of that, you can also expect them to gradually develop more value-adds and better integration to various other pieces, which can get really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
On the down side, you have less control over the environment that runs the builds, and you do not have access back to your intranet environment (think databases that you need to talk to, for example.) Also, in the current pricing (8.5 cents/hour of EC2 vs 1 cent/minute of CB), if your build takes longer than 9 minutes, you'll save more by just using Hudson EC2 plugin.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I think one of the sweet spots is Hudson that's well integrated with on-premise cloud solution. As you can see in <a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/brian.chan/blog/-/blogs/improving-quality-with-100-hudson-test-servers">the discussion with Liferay Hudson setup</a>, with sufficient load it gets cheaper to have your own hardware, and many companies need some degree of control to the build/test environment that matches with their production environment. Plus with those on-premise virtualized environments, you can do <a href="http://www.govirtual.org/docs/DOC-1510">snapshots and forks</a>, which can be made to do <b>very</b> interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think the part that everyone can agree on is that the elasticity of build environment is hugely useful to the CI environment, as <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/articles/gen_hudson.jsp">I discussed in my JavaOne 2009 talk</a> (<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/download/attachments/37323793/Hudson+J1+2009.ppt?version=1&modificationDate=1244127211000">slides</a>.) I'm very happy to see that the foundation work we've made in Hudson for this is getting validated more and more, and I think the added elasticity will drive a lot more changes in Hudson and more broadly into the way we develop software. It is an exciting time!<br/>

Hudson Anonymous Usage Data
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
In late 2008, the Hudson team released version 1.264 which added an anonymous reporting feature (you can opt-out in the "Manage Hudson" screen). The reporting feature has been sending information back to the Hudson team to help us understand how Hudson is used in aggregate; the info being reported includes the number of jobs configured, slave configurations, what plugins (and what versions of those plugins) are installed, and more. This data has not been available publicly until now! The raw data needed to be decrypted and scrubbed of any potentially identifying information, such as non-public plugin names or usernames in snapshot versions. We've finally scrubbed the data and are <strong>making it available</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
The data is currently in monthly JSON bundles, organized by unique install key. We've filtered out reports of installations without any jobs configured, as well as any installations with only one report in a given month. <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like access to the data, please send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net or jump onto the <A href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/chat">IRC channel</a> and ask - we'll send you the URL and a private username/password which you'll need to access the info. We're also planning to do more analysis of the data ourselves, for now feast your eyes on <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">this spreadsheet</a>, which shows the total number of unique installations seen per month and the number of unique installations of each publicly available plugin per month.<br/>
<br/>
