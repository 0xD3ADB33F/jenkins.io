<p><em>This is a guest post by Manuel Recena Soto (aka recena).</em></p>

<p>Users of the plug-in know that it has undergone <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Subversion+Plugin#SubversionPlugin-ChangeLog">very important changes</a> in the last two years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some of these changes resulted in regressions for some users that weren’t properly addressed in subsequent releases. Many users were therefore forced to keep using an older release of the plugin to keep their instances running.</p>

<p>To fix this difficult situation I've decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.</p>

<p>In order to do so, <a href="https://github.com/recena/">me</a>, my colleague <a href="https://github.com/christ66">Steven Christou</a> and other members of the community have drawn up a plan.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks we will be focusing our efforts on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going through the Jira tickets
    <ul>
      <li>Checking whether they are duplicated</li>
      <li>Checking whether they are still relevant</li>
      <li>Asking for more information from the people who reported them</li>
      <li>Establishing their priority</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
  <li>Investigating bug reports and try to reproduce them</li>
  <li>Fixing serious bugs</li>
  <li>Refactoring the plugin to improve its maintainability.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re planning to publish a new 2.5.x bugfix release once a fortnight. We are not considering the inclusion of new features or improvements. The priority now must be to obtain a stable and reliable plug-in, one that will allow us to take things up again in the future with greater security and peace of mind.</p>

<br/>
<p><br/>
As a first step, he wants to have a kick-off meeting, to get more insights and opinions about what the topics could be and what people want to hear. I'm really looking forward to it as a means to build a local network, so I signed myself up as a speaker of the first meet-up.</p><br/>

<p><a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is an open-source project by Google that provides a platform for managing Docker containers as a cluster. In their own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kubernetes-related services by Google are the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">Google Container Engine</a>, a Kubernetes-powered platform for hosting and managing Docker containers, and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/#overview">Google Container Registry</a>, a private Docker image registry.</p>

<p>Several new Jenkins plugins allow you to make use of Kubernetes and these services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Container+Registry+Auth+Plugin">Google Cloud Registry Auth Plugin</a> allows users to authenticate with the Google Cloud Registry so they can push/pull images. This allows you to use the Google Cloud Registry with existing Docker-related plugins, like <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+build+step+plugin">Docker build step plugin</a> or <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin">CloudBees Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin">Kubernetes Plugin</a> implements a cloud provider for Jenkins, and can create slaves based on Docker images on-demand on your Kubernetes cluster or the Google Cloud Platform.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><a href="http://youtu.be/1Qn4jEwAeGc">http://youtu.be/1Qn4jEwAeGc</a></b><br /><br/>
Above is the screencast associated with this blog post<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
If you have ever used Jenkins you are familiar with what I am about to described, wading your way through job configuration page, looking for the settings that are important, and, depending on your plugin use, wondering where all these other setting came from and what they do.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
Depending on how long you have used Jenkins, your negative opinion of this experience may vary. If you are a long-time user, you might even view the configuration page with that same reassuring nostalgia seeing a Facebook post from your ugly room mate induces. ‘Yup,he is still ugly and backwards, but we had some good times, back then.’ If you are a newer Jenkins user, it may well send you off to search the web for a viable alternative tool.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
The good news is that CloudBees, in cooperation with the greater Jenkins community, is looking to make some long overdue progress sorting through this user interaction in a way that is both approachable to new users and amenable to existing users who have grown comfortable with a great tool and a ‘stalwart friend’ in a world of otherwise clunky world of IT tools. ( that really is the swiss army knife of build automation.)<br/>
</p><br/>
<p>If you happen to have had the opportunity to have attended any of the recent Jenkins User Conferences in Washington, DC, or London, you may have seen Tom and my presentation, which served as our initial introduction of this effort to the Jenkins Community. In this article and the associated video, I will be focusing specifically on the Create and Configuration screens in Jenkins, discussing some of the larger proposed changes, providing some context for the changes and examining their possible repercussions on existing plugins and future plugin development. </p><br/>
<br/>
<h3>History of Jenkins</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
For newer Jenkins users, I have found the following visual a helpful guide to understanding the history of Jenkins and how its graphical user interfaces has evolved:</p><br/>
<br/>
<img src="/sites/default/files/images/history-jenkins_590.jpg" alt="Jenkins timeline: a long history" /><br/>
<p><br/>
The first thing to notice here, is that Jenkins has been around for a long time and in a lot of ways is really fundamental to the art of creating software. Back in 2005, the then Hudson project was using pretty much the same cave chalk as everyone else. 6 years later, the code and community underwent its most substantial transformation to date, as Jenkins emerged as the dominant fork of the Hudson project. If you look closely, you will see the GUI reflected that transformation by….. changing the picture of the butler. In recent times, the interface has taken a few additional steps forward, most notably by moving to a responsive CSS driven layout from its table based origin, but the pace of these changes has been very much akin to the pace of evolution. Slow.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
In our next phase of graphic interface development, however, Tom and I are looking to be a little more directed in our efforts and push the GUI toward a blend of strategic and tactical advancements that will help Jenkins take advantage of some of the advances in web design and browser technologies that have happened over the last 10 years. Our first major push will be in the job creation and configuration tasks.<br/>
</p><br/>
<h3>Creating and Configuring</h3><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p><br/>
[image]</p><br/>
<p>In addition to a bit of a refresh of the look of these forms, this new effort focuses on the importance of dividing information and presentation into clear categories that ideally are meaningful to both new and veteran users of Jenkins alike. </p><br/>
<br/>
<p>In some cases, Jenkins has these categories already in the GUI, but misses the mark in clarification and emphasis. In other cases, additional categorizing concepts will need to be added. Compare the above screens to the existing screens.<br/>
</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>The first thing you are likely to notice when comparing these two sets of screens is that in the existing screens, there is very little in the way of visual markers segmenting the form input choices on either the item type selection screens (fig 4 vs 2) or the configuration pages (fig 5 vs 3). Adding each new plugin progressively aggravates the situation, and consequently, as your Jenkins installation grows in sophistication and robustness, the average users ability to find the fundamental configuration settings in the sea of ad-hoc options diminishes. While adding functionality typically adds some amount of additional complexity to a UI, by giving each configuration option a visually distinguishable space in the form, the challenge can be greatly diminished and the pattern of creating an ever growing scrolling of toilet paper list of form elements can be avoided.</p><br/>
<p>For figures 2 and 4, you might also notice that I have chosen Jenkins instances that already have several plugins installed as the basis for my example screens. You might rightly argue that for a basic install, there are not a lot of item types to create, so categorizing them adds a needless layer of complexity. Fair enough. It is my belief, though, that our software can be smart enough to count the item types available for creation and count the number within each category and handle the categorization as necessary. Counting and sorting is something that computers do incredibly well and is not the sort of thing busy people need to be overly burdened with.</p><br/>
<p>In addition to the code being intelligent about when to present grouping categories to the user, The screen interaction can be similarly intelligent in how it enables the user to selectively show and hide the categories of interest. The following screenshot shows the configuration page focused in on CVS a particular option configuration in the source code management section of the configuration page. It, in turn, has its own sub settings for additional modules and locations (see fig 6).</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>...and wait for it... ...for comparison, here is today’s CVS settings page...</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>Despite some serious indentation, the existing page offers significantly less clarity about which settings pertain specifically to CVS instead of other aspects of a Jenkins job.</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>Identifying which settings go with which segment becomes all the more confusing when sub-sections can be re-ordered. To show you what I mean and fit the screen on a single printed page, I am needing to muck with the aspect ratio of today’s screen.</p><br/>
<p>The image on the left (fig 7) shows a 2 step build process, each with sub parameters.</p><br/>
<p>There are some fascinating looking red delete buttons in here, I hope I know exactly what part of the build step I am about to blow away.... Did I mention these segments can be re-ordered? Care to guess which form inputs will move with which steps?</p><br/>
<p>[image]</p><br/>
<p>By contrast, the above screen shows the same 2 build steps with the same parameters. We still have our friend, Mr. Red Delete button, but now it is a good bit clearer who will get blown away.<br/>
Also, it is considerably clearer which block will be reordered, should I choose to do so.</p><br/>
<h3>What about plugins?</h3><br/>
<p>If you are a long-time Jenkins user, you may have a guess as to why some of these changes have been slow in coming, and if you are a plugin developer, you definitely know. These input controls have a lot of extension points in them that allow plugins to influence the content of this configuration screen. As a result, how plugins will respond to even the most minor layout changes is somewhat of a mystery. Further, the GUI control elements that make up the form are available to plugin authors to embed as they see fit in their own GUI elements. As a consequence, we have some serious compatibility issues ahead. These challenges are not at all trivial.</p><br/>
<p>Fortunately, however, I believe with some careful manipulation and diligent testing we can overcome these challenges. The first set of changes are likely to revolve around a file called “hudson-behavior.js”. This file does most of the Jenkins client-side UI magic. If there is data to be bound to a control, this is the file that is likely to handle it. The difficulty with this file stems from two factors, its age (it is written following Yahoo UI framework patterns  which have since been abandoned by Yahoo and the rest of the industry), and a presumption that the page layout will be governed by a single giant HTML table (likely due to the table renaissance happening around the same time, thanks to the emergence of GWT). Regardless of this bit of history trivia, these two issues combine to make changes to the HTML DOM structure of any Jenkins page problematic. Methods such as “findFollowingTR” assume a very rigid parent-child element positioning based on page layout rather than on the logical relationship between the data elements. The good news here is that despite some of their unfortunate names, can be refactored to both find the relevant element based on today’s table structure as well as a future logical nesting of related elements. With that change in place, Jenkins will continue to function as it always has and a future configuration DOM structure can share the same infrastructure.</p><br/>
<p><br/>
The second step here will be finding efficient ways to integrate more modern Javascript libraries, such as JQuery and Bootstrap into the Jenkins GUI.  We will want these libraries to be easier and cleaner for plugin authors to access than PrototypeJS and Yahoo UI are today. Likely this will involve using a Browserify/Requirejs like pattern to control script inclusion in page to avoid naming conflicts, excessively file attachment and global space pollution.</p><br/>
<p>The final step would then be to begin amending, replacing and augmenting the Jelly based form control set, and thus, transforming the look and behavior of the Jenkins UI. As always, Jenkins is an open community, and we at CloudBees view that as a cherished cornerstone of our own corporate culture. Thus, at every phase of this undertaking we are eager to solicit feedback from and encourage participation by you the members of the community. Feel free to comment directly on this article. Additionally, I am maintaining and active thread on the Jenkins Developer group (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/6BdWZt35dTQ</a>). I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post by Kirill Merkushev at Yandex. I met him at JUC Europe where he showed me the project he was working on: Juseppe. It looked really interesting, so I asked him to write this guest post.</em></p>

<p>When you write your first custom Jenkins plugin for internal use, it's easy enough to deploy it on one or maybe two Jenkins instances. You can save it on your local drive and upload the HPI file via the Jenkins Plugin Manager as needed. It's easy to do this for a few releases. But as your experience grows, the number of plugins and their releases grows as well. The plugins directory on your local drive soon looks like a garbage dump, and it's difficult to find that most recent version of any plugin. And if you have a lot of Jenkins instances coordinating updates of your plugins may cause a lot of pain.</p>

<p>A similar situation is when you contribute a much-needed patch to an existing plugin, but you don't have the time to wait until your pull request is be merged and a new release is cut. Or you may need to patch a plugin in ways not suitable for distribution, and decide to effectively fork the plugin for use on your Jenkins instances. How are you going to do this?</p>

<p>A solution avoiding the problems from these situations is to set up your own update site to serve your private plugin builds. Juseppe allows you to do this quickly and easily.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-juseppe">What is Juseppe?</h2>

<p><em>Juseppe</em> is an acronym for <em>Jenkins Update Site Embedded for Plugin Publishing Easily</em>. Juseppe can help you set up a Jenkins update site in just a few minutes.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
