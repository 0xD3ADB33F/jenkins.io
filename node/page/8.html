<p>The 2015 JUC World Tour dates are rapidly approaching. Since the community has grown so tremendously since last year, the JUC in each city will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users in that region.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa"> Kohsuke </a>will, as always, be the opening keynote speaker at each JUC. But, with the conference going from one to two days, I am happy to announce that <a href="http://www.realgenekim.me/"> Gene Kim </a> will be another keynote on the second day! He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1428523232"> The Phoenix Project </a> and a thought leader in DevOps.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>To have these two experts in one place will provide a great opportunity to talk about Jenkins as the foundation of continuous delivery and DevOps practices.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Another exciting announcement: the 2015 Jenkins World Tour will run alongside the CD Summit conferences for both days (at the U.S. East, Europe and U.S. West locations only). Attendees of either conference can attend any of the talks and presentations at both events. Learn more about what <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit"> CD Summit 2014 </a> was like to get an idea for <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit-2015/"> this year's event.</a></p><br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Registration for all 2015 JUC locations is open. Early bird pricing ends May 1!</b></p><br/>

Good bye Java6

<p><br/>
About two years ago, we bumped our runtime JRE requirement <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/commit/core/3431a7cba">from Java5 to Java6</a>. And so the time has come once again for us to finally move on to Java7. Because of all the new language features, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/sw_WepGw0Pk">many of us the developers really wanted to move right on to Java8</a>, but after much discussion we settled to move to Java7 first and then to Java8.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So here is the plan:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Starting Jenkins 1.608, we start advertising that we will be moving on to Java7, which is why you are reading this.<br/>
<li>Starting Jenkins 1.610 (2 weeks from now), we will ship so-called 51.0 class files that will only load on Java7+. This gives some more warnings to those who don't read our blog.<br/>
<li>Unless we hear uproar from users, starting around 1.614 (6 weeks from now), core developers will start linking directly to new Java7 APIs. <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/thinking-about-moving-servlet-30">We will move on to servlet 3.0 at this time as well</a>.<br/>
<li>The current 1.596 line of LTS will remain compatible with Java6, and most likely the next LTS line will also remain compatible with Java6. So LTS users have additional 3 months before upgrading to Java7.<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Java7 has more NIO improvements that allow us to do some file I/O in more portable manner. Similarly, servlet 3.0 will help us build more interactive UI.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Your Jenkins master and all the build slaves need to be running on Java7+. Similarly, those who are using the Maven2 job type must also run Maven with Java7+. However, this does not prevent you from using Jenkins to build your applications that are targeted to earlier versions of Java. According to our research, most platforms people run Jenkins on has been already shipping Java7 for quite some time now. But if you have a good reason why we shouldn't force everyone to Java7, please let us know ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To put this into context, <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml">Oracle will not release updates to Java7 past April 2015</a>. We have always recommended users to run the latest general release according to Oracle, which is currently Java8. As I said, I suspect we will be requiring Java8 pretty soon. So if you are still running Java6, you should definitely upgrade to Java8.<br/>

<p><br/>
For the past few weeks, I've burnt a lot of midnight oil to <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence">get Confluence containerized</a>. The goal is to make Confluence upgrade more manageable and testable. In the proces, I've not only containerized Confluence, but also containerized <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-cache">some other services</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/mock-ldap">mock LDAP server</a>, to be able to test the copy of the production Confluence dataset against newer versions of Confluence before upgrading production.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The infra team is currently <a href="http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-infra/2015-April/000292.html">targeting this weekend</a> to migrate our current Confluence instance to this new container, and use the opportunity to move the service to a bigger system. Currently JIRA and Confluence has to live within 2.5GB RAM from the same host, and it's really stretching both services. The new box has 4GB of RAM, and we are splitting JIRA and Confluence to two different servers. So there's a lot of head room.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So please expect some Wiki outage over the next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<P><br/>
As always, our sincere thank you to <a href="http://osuosl.org/">Oregon State University Open Source Lab</a> for generously hosting our servers. Please donate to them to show your support. Similarly, thank you <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> for generously providing the license for running Confluence.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If this goes well, JIRA will follow suit.

In 2014 Google announced that they will be shutting down their OpenID 2.0 authentication endpoint and replacing it with Google+ Sign-in, a library built on top of OpenID Connect. <b>The old Google endpoint will shut down on April 20th, 2015!</b> Accordingly, if you are using the Jenkins OpenID plugin to authenticate users with the ‘Google Apps SSO’ feature (typically when Google hosts your personal or corporate email), you need to upgrade. Ryan Campbell took the initiative to develop the new Google Login plugin which implements the Google+ Sign-in functionality. This is the recommended solution going forward. Follow the steps <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Login+Plugin">here</a> to configure it for your site. <b>Note that you DON’T need to have a Google+ social network account/profile. Any Google account can be used.</b><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you find yourself locked out of your Jenkins system after the old endpoint is shut down you will need to follow the steps <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Disable+security">here</a> to disable Jenkins security temporarily. Then you can connect without authentication and switch to the Google Login plugin. You will probably want to uninstall the old OpenID plugin at that point as well.<br/>

Jenkins User Conference – Save the Date
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have some exciting news to share with you! We have finalized most of the dates and locations for the 2015 Jenkins User Conference (JUC) World Tour.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Save the date(s):</p><br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>US East (Washington DC): June 18-19</li><br/>
<li>Europe (London): June 23-24</li><br/>
<li>Israel: July 16 (ETA)</li><br/>
<li>US West (Santa Clara): September 2-3</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p>The big news? The JUC agenda has been expanded this year to cover two days! That means you get twice as many opportunities to learn how others are using Jenkins and to network with other Jenkins users.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers"><b>CALL FOR PAPERS IS OPEN FOR ALL JUC CONFERENCES</b></a></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>We need JUC speakers! <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers"><b>The Call for Papers is open now and you can apply here.</b></a> This is an opportunity for YOU to give back to the community by sharing your Jenkins knowledge and success. Jenkins speakers contribute significantly to the overall JUC experience.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>In return for speaking, you will receive free admission to the conference and fame/fortune within the Jenkins community. OK, we can’t guarantee the latter, but we <i>can</i> guarantee the former! <b>Hurry and apply now, because</b> <b>the Call for Papers deadline for US East and Europe expires on March 22, 2015.</b></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Not interested in speaking? Another way to contribute to the community is by letting us know who you want to hear from. Nominate or refer that amazing speaker and we’ll do the rest. Contact <a href="mailto:alytong13@gmail.com">alytong13@gmail.com</a></p><br/>

<br/>
<p>Lastly, be a JUC sponsor. Any organization can do this – whether a vendor that sells into the Jenkins ecosystem or a company that has received value from Jenkins and wants to give back to the community. <b><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/2015-juc-and-cd-summit-world-tour-sponsorships">You can find out more here.</a> </b>(NOTE: JUC is not a moneymaking venture for the community – so sponsorships do make a difference.)</p>

<p><br/>
As a part of <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-celebration-day-february-26">the Jenkins 100K celebration</a>, Dean Yu, Andrew Bayer, R. Tyler Croy, Chris Orr, and myself got together late Tuesday evening to go over the history of the project, how big the community was back then, how we grow, where we are now, and maybe a bit about future.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We got carried away and the recording became longer than we all planned. But it has some nice sound bites, back stage stories, and stuff even some of us didn't know about! I hope you'll enjoy it.<br/>
