<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference</a> is back to San Francisco after a world tour. The conference is on the 30th of this month (Sunday), which makes it back to back with JavaOne, just like the last year. This schedule allows the community people from all over the world to attend and talk, so you see speakers from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JevgeniKabanov">different part</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#BaruchSadogursky">the world</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
You can see <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">the agenda and the speaker list here</a>, there's a number of speakers from the big/serious users of Jenkins in the bay area, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JustinRyan">NetFlix</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#MaxSpring">Cisco</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JamesBlair">HP</a>. All of these guys not only just use Jenkins but wrote additional plugins/programs to really tailor Jenkins into fitting their needs, and I think those would be really informative for those who are already using Jenkins, as well as those who are thinking about using Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This time we also have a couple of talks that discuss how to develop plugins. In JUC Israel, I was pleasantly surprised that a talk on this topic attracted a lot of people! If you are interested in writing a plugin, this would be a great chance to get started.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are also trying to bring <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">the Jenkins project meeting</a>, which normally happens in IRC, into the real world in this conference. We are hoping that this would allow those who don't normally come to the meeting to voice their thoughts. If you are interested, feel free to add stuff to the agenda list!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And oh, did you check out who's on the sponsors list this year?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I hope I convinced you that you must come to this conference &mdash; if so, <a href="http://juc-san-francisco-september-2012-eorg.eventbrite.com/">please register</a>. I've been told that right now you can use the promotion code <tt>JUC-2012SF</tt> to cut the price in half, so please use it while it still works!<br/>

<p>Recently, Jenkins User Conference organizer Alyssa Tong sent out the following request:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenkins User Conf SF is looking for volunteers to help us record the                                                                                        <br />
sessions. Pls drop me an email if you're able to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're trying to make sure we can capture video of as much of this year's conference as possible, but the only way we can do that is with your help!</p>

<p>If you'll be in town for JavaOne, or just live in the bay area, drop Alyssa an email at <code>atong@cloudbees.com</code>.</p>

Report: Intro to Jenkins meet-up in Copenhagen
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have hosted two informal meetups introducing Jenkins Continuous Integration Server.</p>

<p>The first in end of June (announced here on this blog) and the second on the 7th of August. The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days before, but had very good attendance  - the second was completely booked (15 seats).</p>

<p>The agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about Jenkins and finally a live demo.
The live demo starts from scratch by downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.</p>

<p>The meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola. The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.</p>

<p>As the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.</p>

<p>The meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.</p>

<p>These informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as it  is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.</p>

<p>Because these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other topics.</p>

<p>If you're interested in more Jenkins and CI related meet-ups in the Copenhagen area, visit <a href="http://www.praqma.net">our homepage</a> or follow the <code>#pragma</code> hashtag on Twitter.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href="http://www.praqma.net/jciusrcph12">Jenkins User Event in Copenhagen</a> coming in September.</p>

<p><br/>
<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/category/tags/juc">Jenkins User Conference</a> is touring around the world and coming back to San Francisco for this September, colocated with JavaOne.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And here is <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">the call for papers</a> &mdash; we'd love users and plugin developers to share their experience with others. Please tell us how you combine plugins in an interesting way, how some of the features in Jenkins did or did not work for you, tricks you use to effectively manage Jenkins instances, and so on.<br/>
<br/>

Jenkins User Conference Israel

I'm back from the latest Jenkins User Conference in Israel, and I had such a fun (except the part where I strained my lower back on the day I head back to home so 10+5 hour flights were a torture.) I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach.<br/>

For me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house. Needless to say I took a lot of pictures. Hudson was great, and I got a wet-wipe in the end to wipe my hands off with Hudson.<br/>

After I and Shlomi have done the keynote, Amir from HP did a wonderful job showing off how he uses the multi-configuration project type (AKA "matrix project".) This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks.<br/>

Sacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing &mdash; if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4.<br/>

<p><br/>
Eyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.)<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
Another talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call "super Jenkins admins" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins. And those those extra finish makes all the difference!<br/>

The conference concluded with a social in the garden looking a sunset into the Mediterranean sea. Thank you very much for JFrog and CloudBees for making this event happen, and Marina in particular for lining up all the ducks in a row.<br/>

I deployed <a href="http://kohsuke.org/2012/06/22/potd-confluence-static-cache-generator-plugin/">a new static cache frontend</a> to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins Wiki</a> a few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This change should be mostly invisible to users, except that hopefully you would notice that the pages load a lot faster.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Also some pages use macros that doesn't work well with caches. For example, the <tt>chart</tt> macro appears to use one-time URL to generated images, so they cannot be cached. For those pages, add <tt>nocache</tt> as a label, and the page will not be cached.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you see some glitches in the caching behaviour, let us know!

<p><strong>Praqma inviterer til Gå-Hjem-Møde i Allerød, onsdag d 27. juni kl 17:00. Få en introduktion og demo af Jenkins CI server (Open Source). Vi byder på pizza og en kold øl eller vand. Arrangement er gratis, tilmelding er nødvendig.</strong></p>

<p>Continuous Integration – er et princip der dikterer, at alle ændringer skal integreres, i det øjeblik de er skabt – kontinuerligt og automatisk. Continous Software Validation går skridtet videre - alle ændringer skal valideres, i det øjeblik de er skabt.</p>

<p>Jenkins Continuous Integration Server hurtigt blevet de facto standard for Continuous Integration. Og den er hjørnestenen i build- og softwarevaliderings-systemet og bindeledet mellem samtlige tools i hele den tool-chain, man ønsker at indføre eller udbygge.</p>

<p>På Jenkins konfigureres jobs, som udover at bygge og eksekvere unittests også kan tage ansvar for valideringer som statisk kodeanalyse, rapportering af warnings, coverage-målinger af unittests, automatisk generering af dokumentation, eksekvering af funktionelle tests etc.</p>

<p>Vi holder et uformelt gå-hjem-møde med pizza, øl og sodavand, hvor vi præsenterer Jenkins Continuous Integration og viser dig, hvordan du nemt kommer i gang, så du allerede dagen efter kan høste synlige fordele på dine projekter.</p>

<p>Du kan få helt ny viden og indsigt i din kodebase, og du kan skabe grundlag for ændring af arbejdsgange i udviklingen.</p>

<p>Jenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (<a href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2012" title="BOSC 2012">BOSC 2012</a>) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about <a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a>.</p>

<p>BOSC 2012 will be held just before <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012">ISMB 2012</a>, while registration is through ISMB you don't have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.</p>

<p>I will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!</p>

<h3 id="about-biouno">About BioUno</h3>

<p>BioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics_workflow_management_systems" title="Bioinformatics Workflow Management Systems Wiki entry">biology workflows</a>.
BioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for
bioinformatics tools like
<a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a>,
<a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html" title="Structure">Structure</a>,
<a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/" title="Figtree">Figtree</a>,
<a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page" title="Beast">Beast</a>,
among <a href="http://www.biouno.org/biouno-plugins/" title="BioUno Plug-ins">others</a>.</p>

<p>While the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific
tools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,
web interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and
management, as well as other important low level tasks.</p>

<p>BioUno is similar to <a href="http://biohpc.org/" title="BioHPC">BioHPC</a>,
<a href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a> and
<a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/" title="Taverna">Taverna</a>, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.</p>

<p>However, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins" title="Extending Jenkins">extending Jenkins</a>
and troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins" title="Jenkins Plug-ins">existing plug-ins</a> (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).</p>

<p>There are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" title="Hadoop">Hadoop</a> node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.</p>

<p>The project is being developed by <a href="http://www.tupilabs.com" title="TupiLabs">TupiLabs</a> under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.
