Last week, <a href="http://www.praqma.com/">praqma</a> was organizing in Copenhague a "Jenkins User Event". A User Event, compared to JenkinsConf, is a lighter meeting with (suposed to be) reduced costs organized by volunteers. Praqma got sponsorship from both <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> and <a href="http://www.programmingresearch.com/">Programing Research</a> so that they can book a high quality conference room and prepare a nice meeting with all commodities.<br /><br/>

That was my first travel to Danemark. I enjoyed the winds-farm on northern sea as well as the duty-free lego shop at airport, but didn't have much time to discover the city - so will have to come back next year ;)<br /><br/>

Thursday was about a <a href="http://www.praqma.com/jcicodecamp12">Jenkins Code Camp</a> (aka "hackathon"), that I joined late at 2pm due to flight being delayed. 20 geeks were talking about some technical issues, new features, implementation strategies for a large set of topics. I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558">creating a new extension</a> point in jenkins-core. Those already confident with jenkins development helped to write this code, some discovered the extension point design as well as way to contribute to jenkins (github pull request, etc), some were looking at jenkins source code for first time so learned a lot.<br /><br/>

Friday was the Jenkins User Event. To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was "packed" into&nbsp;afternoon. This let praqma get a "reasonable" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing !<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Conference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees.<br /><br/>
<br style="clear: both;" /><br/>
After&nbsp;Lars Kruse&nbsp;welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
The rest of the conference was single-track.<br /><br/>

<br /><br/>
1rst session was about "<i>facilitate strategic reuse of software</i>" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said "Clearcase facilitated" sharing components &nbsp;-I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Tales from the trenches</i>" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase,&nbsp;<u>helping a lot</u> early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, "some tools a radically better" and "deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal".<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Continuous Code Inspection</i>" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs.<br /><br/>

<br /><br/>
Coffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ...<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Sony was presenting its "<i>Huge Jenkins Cluster</i>", with 4 master, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 slaves, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated slave machine with android devices connected through USB.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Such a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
With 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a slave is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Remaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins master and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Next talk was mine, exposing <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb">Jenkins Enterprise</a> and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb">pre-tested commits</a>. Hope you enjoyed the talk.<br /><br/>

This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source :<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>costs - for sure,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>but also open standards and interoperability,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>and contribution to public good.&nbsp;</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
This last point distinguish "<i>innovators</i>" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and "<i>free riders</i>" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what "contributing" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;)<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br style="clear: both;" /><br/>
Meeting ended with a "socialize" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches. A nice time to discuss with speakers, know a face to match an #irc nickname, discuss about everything geeks like to discuss about, and round off this pleasant day.<br />

<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference</a> is back to San Francisco after a world tour. The conference is on the 30th of this month (Sunday), which makes it back to back with JavaOne, just like the last year. This schedule allows the community people from all over the world to attend and talk, so you see speakers from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JevgeniKabanov">different part</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#BaruchSadogursky">the world</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
You can see <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">the agenda and the speaker list here</a>, there's a number of speakers from the big/serious users of Jenkins in the bay area, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JustinRyan">NetFlix</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#MaxSpring">Cisco</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JamesBlair">HP</a>. All of these guys not only just use Jenkins but wrote additional plugins/programs to really tailor Jenkins into fitting their needs, and I think those would be really informative for those who are already using Jenkins, as well as those who are thinking about using Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This time we also have a couple of talks that discuss how to develop plugins. In JUC Israel, I was pleasantly surprised that a talk on this topic attracted a lot of people! If you are interested in writing a plugin, this would be a great chance to get started.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are also trying to bring <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">the Jenkins project meeting</a>, which normally happens in IRC, into the real world in this conference. We are hoping that this would allow those who don't normally come to the meeting to voice their thoughts. If you are interested, feel free to add stuff to the agenda list!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And oh, did you check out who's on the sponsors list this year?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I hope I convinced you that you must come to this conference &mdash; if so, <a href="http://juc-san-francisco-september-2012-eorg.eventbrite.com/">please register</a>. I've been told that right now you can use the promotion code <tt>JUC-2012SF</tt> to cut the price in half, so please use it while it still works!<br/>

<p>Recently, Jenkins User Conference organizer Alyssa Tong sent out the following request:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenkins User Conf SF is looking for volunteers to help us record the                                                                                        <br />
sessions. Pls drop me an email if you're able to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're trying to make sure we can capture video of as much of this year's conference as possible, but the only way we can do that is with your help!</p>

<p>If you'll be in town for JavaOne, or just live in the bay area, drop Alyssa an email at <code>atong@cloudbees.com</code>.</p>

Report: Intro to Jenkins meet-up in Copenhagen
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have hosted two informal meetups introducing Jenkins Continuous Integration Server.</p>

<p>The first in end of June (announced here on this blog) and the second on the 7th of August. The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days before, but had very good attendance  - the second was completely booked (15 seats).</p>

<p>The agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about Jenkins and finally a live demo.
The live demo starts from scratch by downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.</p>

<p>The meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola. The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.</p>

<p>As the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.</p>

<p>The meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.</p>

<p>These informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as it  is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.</p>

<p>Because these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other topics.</p>

<p>If you're interested in more Jenkins and CI related meet-ups in the Copenhagen area, visit <a href="http://www.praqma.net">our homepage</a> or follow the <code>#pragma</code> hashtag on Twitter.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href="http://www.praqma.net/jciusrcph12">Jenkins User Event in Copenhagen</a> coming in September.</p>

<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/category/tags/juc">Jenkins User Conference</a> is touring around the world and coming back to San Francisco for this September, colocated with JavaOne.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And here is <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">the call for papers</a> &mdash; we'd love users and plugin developers to share their experience with others. Please tell us how you combine plugins in an interesting way, how some of the features in Jenkins did or did not work for you, tricks you use to effectively manage Jenkins instances, and so on.<br/>

I'm back from the latest Jenkins User Conference in Israel, and I had such a fun (except the part where I strained my lower back on the day I head back to home so 10+5 hour flights were a torture.) I have this impression that Israeli people form a close-knit community on their own (somewhat like Japanese people do), perhaps because of the difference in the language or the culture. One of the great things about those communities are that people are well connected, and so reaching the right ears and spreading the ideas are easier. JUC Israel turns out to be the biggets JUC we had this year. Shlomi told me that some 230 people registered and 240 people showed up, and this negative last-minute cancellation ratio is unheard of! We had booths from sponsors, 2 concurrent tracks of technical talks, and wonderful Israeli food, in a nice hotel by the beach.<br/>

For me, the conference started the night before, when JFrog folks took us to the Hudson restaurant, which was a wonderful steak house. Needless to say I took a lot of pictures. Hudson was great, and I got a wet-wipe in the end to wipe my hands off with Hudson.<br/>

After I and Shlomi have done the keynote, Amir from HP did a wonderful job showing off how he uses the multi-configuration project type (AKA "matrix project".) This is one of the areas where we made a lot of improvements lately, and one that I highlighted in my talk. I've always been feeling that this feature needs to be advertised more, so it was just perfect in that regard. It was also very useful for me personally, as I got some inspirations about improvements while he talks.<br/>

Sacha then talked about why the future of server-side applications are in PaaS. He had this one point where he said increasing the failure rate of software projects isn't necessarily a bad thing &mdash; if in a time frame of a year, you can do 10 projects and 2 succeed, then while that's only 20% success rate, it's better than doing 4 projects in the same time and having only 1 succeed. IOW, a machine-gun does a far more damage than a pistol, even though their accuracy can be much lower. And PaaS/Continuous-delivery plays a central role here becauses those are what lets you deliver 10 features in a year, instead of 4.<br/>

Eyal from RedHat and Ronen from Ginger did two sessions showing off their use of Jenkins. One of the common theme in them is to use a text format (Puppet for Eyal and Groovy DSL for Ronen) to manage definitions of a large number of jobs. I think there's a lot of value in managing job definitions outside the current GUI, and I'm going to encourage Ronen to move his Groovy DSL project into the Jenkins CI project. I also felt that the template feature in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees was validated, as it provides a similar capability (and in my opinion more easily deployable.)<br/>

<p><br/>
Another talk that made a strong impression on me was the introductory plugin development talk from Noam, who works for JFrog and develops the Jenkins Artifactory plugin. I expected there to be only like 20-30 people, but it turns out about half the audience is there, indicating the high degree of interest to customizing Jenkins! In the past, all my favorite JUC talks came from those who I call "super Jenkins admins" who not only figure out how to combine some plugins, but also developed a few glue plugins. And those those extra finish makes all the difference!<br/>

The conference concluded with a social in the garden looking a sunset into the Mediterranean sea. Thank you very much for JFrog and CloudBees for making this event happen, and Marina in particular for lining up all the ducks in a row.<br/>

<p><strong>Praqma inviterer til Gå-Hjem-Møde i Allerød, onsdag d 27. juni kl 17:00. Få en introduktion og demo af Jenkins CI server (Open Source). Vi byder på pizza og en kold øl eller vand. Arrangement er gratis, tilmelding er nødvendig.</strong></p>

<p>Continuous Integration – er et princip der dikterer, at alle ændringer skal integreres, i det øjeblik de er skabt – kontinuerligt og automatisk. Continous Software Validation går skridtet videre - alle ændringer skal valideres, i det øjeblik de er skabt.</p>

<p>Jenkins Continuous Integration Server hurtigt blevet de facto standard for Continuous Integration. Og den er hjørnestenen i build- og softwarevaliderings-systemet og bindeledet mellem samtlige tools i hele den tool-chain, man ønsker at indføre eller udbygge.</p>

<p>På Jenkins konfigureres jobs, som udover at bygge og eksekvere unittests også kan tage ansvar for valideringer som statisk kodeanalyse, rapportering af warnings, coverage-målinger af unittests, automatisk generering af dokumentation, eksekvering af funktionelle tests etc.</p>

<p>Vi holder et uformelt gå-hjem-møde med pizza, øl og sodavand, hvor vi præsenterer Jenkins Continuous Integration og viser dig, hvordan du nemt kommer i gang, så du allerede dagen efter kan høste synlige fordele på dine projekter.</p>

<p>Du kan få helt ny viden og indsigt i din kodebase, og du kan skabe grundlag for ændring af arbejdsgange i udviklingen.</p>

<p>[ <strong>Editor's Note:</strong> <em>The following is a post from <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA</a> member <a href="http://kinoshita.eti.br">Bruno P. Kinoshita</a></em> ]</p>

<p>Jenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (<a href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2012" title="BOSC 2012">BOSC 2012</a>) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about Jenkins during my talk about <a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a>.</p>

<p>BOSC 2012 will be held just before <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012">ISMB 2012</a>, while registration is through ISMB you don't have to register for ISMB in order to register for BOSC.</p>

<p>I will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!</p>

<h3 id="about-biouno">About BioUno</h3>

<p>BioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics_workflow_management_systems" title="Bioinformatics Workflow Management Systems Wiki entry">biology workflows</a>.
BioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for
bioinformatics tools like
<a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a>,
<a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html" title="Structure">Structure</a>,
<a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/" title="Figtree">Figtree</a>,
<a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page" title="Beast">Beast</a>,
among <a href="http://www.biouno.org/biouno-plugins/" title="BioUno Plug-ins">others</a>.</p>

<p>While the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by specific
tools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for user control,
web interface, notifications, distributed execution, job schedule and
management, as well as other important low level tasks.</p>

<p>BioUno is similar to <a href="http://biohpc.org/" title="BioHPC">BioHPC</a>,
<a href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a> and
<a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/" title="Taverna">Taverna</a>, in that all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different bioinformatics tools.</p>

<p>However, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins" title="Extending Jenkins">extending Jenkins</a>
and troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins" title="Jenkins Plug-ins">existing plug-ins</a> (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).</p>

<p>There are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in clouds or turn Jenkins into a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" title="Hadoop">Hadoop</a> node, for big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno, definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many bioinformatics tools.</p>

<p>The project is being developed by <a href="http://www.tupilabs.com" title="TupiLabs">TupiLabs</a> under MIT License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.
