Spotlight on: VisFleet
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>For this week's user spotlight, I'm talking to Rasheed Abdul-Aziz of
VisFleet Ltd. out of New Zealand. This being our second "spotlight" on a particular company, the format can still be considered <em>beta</em>; if you have any additional questions for Rasheed, feel free to ask them in the comments and I'll try to get Rasheed to answer.</p>

<p>Similar to the spotlight on ITA Software from last week, VisFleet builds business software helping their customers operate their businesses more effectively through web applications in tandem with mobile applications. While I could endlessly discuss the power and flexibility of Hudson, particularly for building web software, I'll let Rasheed do the majority of the talking, so let's get to it.

Rasheed, thanks for talking with me today, I think I did a poor enough job

It's a pleasure. VisFleet has changed it's direction somewhat, moving from
services into product development. As we move into product, we want to be
responsive to our customers. Agile development is becoming core to how we
operate, and as such, continuous builds and integration became a major
factor. We now plan to offer two products for work planning and and vehicle
tracking. We want to present these systems with a SaaS model. The world of
online, pay as you go software, has a culture of frequent improvements and
responsiveness to user feedback. If we want to do well in this space, it's
important that we can code, test, release and feed back in
tight iterations.

It runs multiple slave types, and automates deploys to different cloud

Mac Mini building our iPhone app, and several Ubuntu Servers testing our web

<br />
In the near future, we will automate integration by first updating an
integration system on the cloud, deploying our system and then running our
tests. All very quickly.

We have very little metric and reporting output from Hudson, and this is
noteworthy in it's absence. It's very important  to use to provide clear

<a href='/blog/2010/02/17/getting-started-building-android-apps-with-hudson/'>
Getting started: Building Android apps with Hudson
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="/sites/default/files/hvisser_android_project.png" align="right" />In this post I'll show a very basic tips on how to compile an Android project using Hudson. Specifically how  I use Hudson to create release versions of my apps.</p>

<h2 id="debug-vs-release">Debug vs Release</h2>
<p>I'm assuming that you are using <a id="aptureLink_s44SkgAX9H" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse%20%28software%29">Eclipse</a> with the <a id="aptureLink_MtfIHO5Nxu" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adt.html">ADT plugin</a>. During development you can test your app on the emulator or a device and resources like R.java and aidl files are compiled for you automatically by the plugin. When it's time to release your app, you'll need to go through some steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must sign your app using a certificate</li>
  <li>You must update your AndroidManifest.xml to remove the android:debuggable attribute</li>
  <li>Replace your Google Maps API debug key with the one belonging to your release certificate (if you are using a MapView)</li>
  <li>Generate an apk package for the release and test it on a device or emulator</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice to automate a few of these steps, and this is where Hudson comes in.</p>

<h2 id="automated-builds-ant">Automated builds: Ant</h2>
<p>For automated builds the Android SDK uses <a id="aptureLink_THdW39aNW6" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Ant">Apache Ant</a>, which Hudson has great support for. To generate a template build.xml you can use the android tool from the SDK using the following command:
&lt;code linenumbers=off&gt;
android create project -n template -t android-7 -p template -k dummy.pkg -a Dummy
&lt;/code&gt;
The target is specified as "android-7" meaning that we are building for Android 2.1. For apps that use MapView we would use "Google Inc.:Google APIs:7". It is a good idea to always <a href="http://d.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#strategies">target the latest SDK</a>. From this template project we'll grab the <em>build.properties</em> and the <em>build.xml</em> and copy those to the Android project that we want to build. Edit <em>build.xml</em> and set the project name to your Android project name.</p>

<p>The <em>local.properties</em> file contains the path to the SDK root and shouldn't be checked in to version control. For our use we'll set the properties that are in that file on the Hudson job configuration page.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-build-in-hudson">Running the build in Hudson</h2>
<p>This part is easy: create a new freestyle job and let it be build with ant. The targets that we want to execute are <code>clean release</code>. Release will compile, package and sign your apk. Now to get this working right, some custom properties should be set (use the Advanced button).</p>

<center><img src="/sites/default/files/hvisser_android_properties.png" /></center>

<hr />
<p><code>
sdk.dir=/Users/hugo/Code/android-sdk-mac
target=Google Inc.:Google APIs:7
key.store=certs/rd-release.keystore
key.alias=rainydays
key.store.password=thisisnotmypassword
key.alias.password=thisisnotmypassword
</code>
The <em>sdk.dir</em> should point to the Android SDK root on your Hudson node. In my case I'm running Hudson locally on my machine.  The <em>target</em> property refers to the SDK we want to use as mentioned earlier.  The <em>key.** properties are related to signing of the apk. My <a href="http://d.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html#strategies">strategy</a> is to have a separate key store and private key for each application that I develop. <img src="/sites/default/files/hvisser_android_archive.png" align="right" /> I also check that keystore in to SVN. I also archive the **-release.apk</em> artifact so that I can download the latest release apk directly from Hudson.  After completing these steps, you should be able to build your Android app with Hudson.</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
## Updating the AndroidManifest for release
…But we're not done yet :) Remember what I said about updating the AndroidManifest.xml? For that we need to edit the build.xml, which by default contains nothing more then a <code><setup></setup></code> tag to pull in the Android SDK ant target definitions. For my Rainy Days application, I adjusted build.xml like this:
<code>
   ...</code></p>
<setup />

<property environment="env" />

<target name="preprocess" if="env.BUILD_TAG">
      <echo>Removing debug attribute from AndroidManifest.xml</echo>
      <replaceregexp file="AndroidManifest.xml" match="android:debuggable=&quot;.*?&quot;" replace="" />
      <echo>Setting release maps key</echo>
      <replaceregexp file="res/layout/maplayout.xml" match="android:apiKey=&quot;.*?&quot;" replace="android:apiKey=&quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;" />			
   </target>

<p><!-- this target is only hooking release processing of the manifest --></p>
<target name="-package-resources" depends="preprocess, android_rules.-package-resources">
   </target>
<p>&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>What the above snippet does is removing the <em>android:debuggable</em> attribute from the <em>AndroidManifest.xml</em> and replacing the maps API key in <em>res/layout/maplayout.xml</em> with the correct key for release. The <code>-package-resources</code> target is pulled in from the Android <em>android_rules.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>Now when Hudson builds my app I get a ready to release apk that I can install on my device or emulator, which is pretty nice.</p>

<p>There is are some issues with this approach however. As you might have noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replacements are done in the workspace, we are not really building <strong>exactly</strong> what's in svn</li>
  <li>Each new build should start out fresh for that reason, for example by using the svn revert option.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally I can not yet tag the release version with the updated files, because the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Subversion+Tagging+Plugin">subversion tagging plugin</a> doesn't support this by design. This could be worked around by adding svn statements in the build.xml however.  For now I don't really mind as I make minor changes to the resource files, but I'll be looking at improving this situation.</p>

<h2 id="things-to-add-unit-testing-coverage">Things to add: unit testing, coverage…</h2>
<p>One thing that I'd really like to add is unit testing. This is a little bit more complicated though, since unit tests require a running emulator and a running emulator requires a gui. The Hudson <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Xvnc+Plugin">Xvnc</a> plugin could be very helpful here.</p>

<p>The Android build scripts for test projects already include <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> output, it shouldn't be to hard to use the Hudson <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Emma+Plugin">plugin</a> for that.</p>

<p>When Hudson is running on a local machine, the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Batch+Task+Plugin">Batch task</a> plugin can automate installing the apk on a device to automate things further.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Building Android applications with Hudson is not that hard, since the builds are based on Ant. By hooking in to the standard Android build targets it's easy to update files like <em>AndroidManifest.xml</em> which in turn makes sure the release process is controlled and predictable.<br />
Android unit tests depend on the emulator which is a little bit more challenging to set up, but Hudson already has some plugins available to make this easier.</p>

Performance improvements in 1.346
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>From time to time, we get a report of out of memory problems in Hudson. It's frequent enough that <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/I'm+getting+OutOfMemoryError">we have a dedicated Wiki page</a> that talks about how to obtain information to help devs work on the problem.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Restarting-hudson-every-day-memory-leaks-td1311161.html">the latest thread</a> from <a id="aptureLink_RTb6QLKuCh" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwoon">David Woon</a> was assumed to be one of those ordinary trouble-shooting sessions, but thanks to Gustaf Lundh, it turned out to be a very interesting exercise.</p>

<p>What we discovered was that the profiler I was using (<a id="aptureLink_VKTrt70n5i" href="http://www.yourkit.com/">Your Kit Profiler</a>), was basically eliminating all the weak/soft references from the picture entirely. If we are looking for leaks, this was the right thing, as those references will be cleared before VM chokes with <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt>. But because of this elimination, I was completely blind to the wasteful memory usage in Jelly, which are only reachable via soft references.</p>

<p>So I used <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/">Eclipse Memory Analyzer</a> and YJP side by side to look into Jelly's memory usage, and based on that insight, I was able to substantially improve the memory usage and speed of Jelly.</p>

<p>I monitor my production Hudson deployment with <a href="http://java.sun.com/performance/jvmstat/visualgc.html">VisualGC</a>, and the result was quite noticable. And I hope you'll notice that the response from Hudson is also snappier.</p>

<p>All these changes are a part of the latest 1.346 release.</p>

Hudson 1.346 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>After some scrambling earlier in the week to get <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/breaking-hudson-1345-released">1.345 out the door</a>, correcting some regressions in 1.344, the Hudson team still rolled out a 1.346 release last Friday, February 12th, 2010. Similar to the past couple releases, 1.346 had a good number of bug fixes, including a a performance fix when dealing with larger build submissions and a substantial revision of the SCM polling code to fix a long-standing issue with the quiet period blocking the build from running (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2180">issue 2180</a>), there were also some additionally memory improvements made to <a id="aptureLink_sglHnjrHm5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Jelly">Jelly</a>, the library with which the majority of Hudson's web interface is rendered, that Kohsuke will detail in a later post.</p>

<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>

<h4 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;

<p>A great community of developers and users is one of the many things that make Hudson a great tool and a fun project to work with, after launching Continuous Blog as an extensions of that community earlier this week there are some thanks in order to those that helped spread the word about CB and in turn, Hudson. Thanks to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everybody on Twitter who retweeted the <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/8796480478">Continuous Blog launch announcement</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.juliansimpson.org/">Julian Simpson</a>, also known as <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/">The Build Doctor</a> for helping <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/02/08/the-official-hudson-weblog/">spread the word</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/kevin_farnham">Kevin Farnham</a> for featuring the launch of Continuous Blog on the <a href="http://java.net">Java.net</a> home page!</li>
</ul>

This Week in Plugins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Since this is the first "This Week in Plugins" (TWiP), I'm trying a fairly basic format out. I'm debating how much information I want to include in these, while I would like to include details on "what's changed" for each plugin over the course of the week, the means of fetching that information would be incredibly tedious (read: no fun) since there's not particularly any standard meta-data to be scraped from the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">wiki</a>. Duplicates have been pruned from the list, meaning the latest release of a plugin is what's being shown; sorting is also by day of release then alphabetical.</p>

Spotlight on: ITA Software

<div class='content'>
<p><a href="http://itasoftware.com/?continuousblog" target="_blank"><img src="/sites/default/files/itasoftware_sm.png" alt="ITA Software" title="ITA Software" align="right" hspace="5" /></a>For the first "User Spotlight" interview <em>ever</em> on Continuous Blog, I am talking with Matt Girard of ITA Software, a Boston-based software company that produces travel industry software which is used by many of the major carriers in the U.S. and abroad. When I sent out <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/8553593409">a message</a> asking for users of Hudson in the corporate space to ping me about doing a "spotlight" on them, ITA Software stuck out in particular; they're hiring a Hudson expert!</p>

<p><a style="margin: 0pt auto; padding: 0px 6px; text-align: center; display: block;" id="aptureLink_oQPlXrRBHE" href="http://twitter.com/equalize/status/8338991375"><img title="Tweet by Matthew Girard" src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/355x210_TwitterArticle/" style="border: 0px none ;" width="355px" height="210px" /></a></p>

<p>The format for the "spotlight" series isn't entirely nailed down yet so feel free to ask questions in the comments section and I'll follow-up with Matt after the fact if need be. That said, without further delay, Matt Girard from ITA Software, on Hudson.

My pleasure, glad to be a part of the community. We have been using Hudson in some form since early 2008. Predictably our usage has increased over time and now encompasses the majority of our automated build and test infrastructure.

Yes, though not to the degree that we have now. Prior to Hudson we were reliant on <a id="aptureLink_0DdF7ImGgA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuildBot">BuildBot</a> for our automated builds, but we were not doing continuous integration
 across our components until after the transition to Hudson. The easy to understand UI and flexibility were primary features that compelled our switch. I should mention
 that when we decided to switch we also evaluated <a id="aptureLink_3DDvWBrYei" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CruiseControl">CruiseControl</a> but Hudson came out on top for our needs.

<strong>Matt</strong>

Our Hudson environments (yes, we have more than one) have been optimized for building C++, Java (all <a id="aptureLink_dkCKWMZxl1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Maven">maven</a> based), Lisp (a surprise to some to be sure <a href="http://itasoftware.com/careers/l_e_t_lisp.html?catid=8" target="_blank">more about that here</a>), and Python on Linux build slaves (Fedora and CentOS).

Our jobs are (loosely) grouped into one of three categories: rpm (we are primarily RedHat based), tests, and tools. The rpm jobs are the actual code builds and individual component unit tests. The test jobs (thank you <a id="aptureLink_ZDsnAh3cPt" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin">parameterized trigger plugin</a>!) are part of a larger cross-component integration testing and promotion scheme. The (handful of) tools jobs support us in tasks such as cleaning up stale sandbox database connections.

Given the flexibility of Hudson, it's safe to say that not everybody is using it in the exact same fashion, is there anything you would consider interesting or noteworthy about the use of Hudson at ITA?

<tr><td align="center" valign="top">
<img src="/sites/default/files/itasoftware_tiny.png" alt="Matt @ ITA" /><br />
<strong>Matt</strong>
</td><td>
I think that our most interesting usage of Hudson has to be how we have combined parameterized builds with the parameterized trigger plugin in order to do cross-component testing of trunk code. More specifically, we pass a properties file (to us a "scoreboard" that tells the jobs what exact revisions of which projects to
 test together) to several jobs and only build a final promotion job if ALL of downstream jobs (with the same scoreboard) passed. In this way we create a hurdle that all of our code must clear before we even consider deploying it anywhere else.


The next most interesting thing we are doing is using Hudson for continuous <em>deployment</em> of monitoring changes into our staging environment. It's quite rewarding to watch a check-in makes it's way through Hudson, into and rpm, and out to a server without a human being involved.

We evolved what became a very large build script (mostly derived from what we had for BuildBot) that handles all of the nitty-gritty details involved in the building, packaging, and testing of our software. Recently we have been working to refactor this into several smaller build tools each with a more focused purpose. The first of these is designed (largely as a wrapper to <a id="aptureLink_IpFANHwY8F" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM%20Package%20Manager">rpmbuild</a>) to standardize our package building while leaving the .spec files (with the real specifics) living alongside the code where they belong.

ITA is a decent size company and there is plenty of work that goes on that does not involve Hudson in any way. Still since we rely on the building and testing that Hudson does in order to promote new code to production, I would say that we are somewhere around an 8.

<p>I'd like to thank Matt again for being a good sport as the very first in what I hope will be a long line of "spotlights" on companies using Hudson to help them work smart, better and faster.

Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We all know that keeping important files in version control is critical, as it ensures problematic changes can be reverted and can serve as a backup mechanism as well. Code and resources are often kept in version control, but it can be easy to forget your continuous integration (CI) server itself! If a disk were to die or fall victim to a <a href="http://twitter.com/progrium/status/7646048501">misplaced</a> <code>rm -rf</code>, you could lose all the history and configuration associated with the jobs your CI server manages.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to create a repository, but it isn’t obvious which parts of your $HUDSON_HOME you’ll want to backup. You’ll also want to have some automation so new projects get added to the repository, and deleted ones get removed. Luckily we have a great tool to handle this: Hudson!</p>

<p>We have a Hudson job which runs nightly, performs the appropriate SVN commands, and checks in. The high-level overview of this job is basically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add any new jobs, users, plugin configurations, et cetera: <code>svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*</code></li>
  <li>Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists (such as a deleted job): <code>svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm</code></li>
  <li>Check it in! <code>svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration"</code>
You’ll want to make sure to use the <code>--non-interactive</code> option for any automated svn operations, as this ensures Subversion won’t hang asking a question but instead fail immediately. You may also need to provide your password with the <code>--password</code> option.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make such a Hudson job, create a new job, tie it to the master (since this is where the configuration files are), set it to build periodically (we use “@midnight”), and add an “Execute shell” build step. Here’s the full script we use, to put into the build step:</p>

<p><code type="bash">
# Change into your HUDSON_HOME.
cd /opt/hudson
# Add any new conf files, jobs, users, and content.
svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*
# Ignore things in the root we don't care about.
echo -e "warnlogn*.logn*.tmpn*.oldn*.bakn*.jarn*.json" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores . &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Ignore things in jobs/* we don't care about.
echo -e "buildsnlast*nnext*n*.txtn*.lognworkspace*ncoberturanjavadocnhtmlreportsnncoverndoclinks" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores jobs/* &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists in Hudson.
svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm
# And finally, check in of course, showing status before and after for logging.
svn st &amp;&amp; svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration" &amp;&amp; svn st
</code></p>

<p>You’ll notice this does some extra things like set the svn:ignores property to provide a relatively clean <code>svn st</code> which it shows before and after the commit for logging purposes. One thing this job <em>doesn’t</em> do is put the build results of your jobs in version control. Because historical build logs and artifacts will never change and are also potentially large, a periodic (daily or weekly) <code>cp</code> or <code>rsync</code> of the <strong>jobs</strong> directory will still give you restorability while keeping your repository lean.</p>

<p>Now you can sleep well at night knowing that your CI server is safe and sound. If you are doing a similar thing with Hudson or another CI system, let us know about your solution!</p>
