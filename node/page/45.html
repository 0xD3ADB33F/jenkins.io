Hudson 1.346 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>After some scrambling earlier in the week to get <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/breaking-hudson-1345-released">1.345 out the door</a>, correcting some regressions in 1.344, the Hudson team still rolled out a 1.346 release last Friday, February 12th, 2010. Similar to the past couple releases, 1.346 had a good number of bug fixes, including a a performance fix when dealing with larger build submissions and a substantial revision of the SCM polling code to fix a long-standing issue with the quiet period blocking the build from running (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2180">issue 2180</a>), there were also some additionally memory improvements made to <a id="aptureLink_sglHnjrHm5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Jelly">Jelly</a>, the library with which the majority of Hudson's web interface is rendered, that Kohsuke will detail in a later post.</p>

<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>

<h4 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Maven modules should not be buildable when the parent project is disabled.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-1375">issue 1375</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;</p>

<pre><code>Fixed the broken quiet period implementation when polling interval is shorter than
the quiet period.  (Changes in SCM impls are needed for this to take effect.) 
(&lt;a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2180"&gt;issue 2180&lt;/a&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Escape username in URLs in case it contains special characters such as "#".
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2610">issue 2610</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Fix sidepanel link for People to be visible and show view-specific info when appropriate.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5443">issue 5443</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Improved HTML rendering, not using closing tags that do not exist in HTML.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5458">issue 5458</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;</p>

<pre><code>Show better error message for missing view type selection when creating a view.
(&lt;a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5469"&gt;issue 5469&lt;/a&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Hudson wasn't properly streaming a large external build submission,
    which can result in OOME and unresponsiveness.
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Enhancements</p>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Use fixed-width font in text area for shell/batch build steps.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5471">issue 5471</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Use user selected icon size on People page.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5447">issue 5447</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Speed/footprint improvement in the HTML rendering.
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Contributors 
This release of Hudson contained 37 commits from 3 different contributors to "core":</p>

This Week in Plugins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Since this is the first "This Week in Plugins" (TWiP), I'm trying a fairly basic format out. I'm debating how much information I want to include in these, while I would like to include details on "what's changed" for each plugin over the course of the week, the means of fetching that information would be incredibly tedious (read: no fun) since there's not particularly any standard meta-data to be scraped from the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">wiki</a>. Duplicates have been pruned from the list, meaning the latest release of a plugin is what's being shown; sorting is also by day of release then alphabetical.</p>

Spotlight on: ITA Software

<div class='content'>
<p><a href="http://itasoftware.com/?continuousblog" target="_blank"><img src="/sites/default/files/itasoftware_sm.png" alt="ITA Software" title="ITA Software" align="right" hspace="5" /></a>For the first "User Spotlight" interview <em>ever</em> on Continuous Blog, I am talking with Matt Girard of ITA Software, a Boston-based software company that produces travel industry software which is used by many of the major carriers in the U.S. and abroad. When I sent out <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/8553593409">a message</a> asking for users of Hudson in the corporate space to ping me about doing a "spotlight" on them, ITA Software stuck out in particular; they're hiring a Hudson expert!</p>

<p><a style="margin: 0pt auto; padding: 0px 6px; text-align: center; display: block;" id="aptureLink_oQPlXrRBHE" href="http://twitter.com/equalize/status/8338991375"><img title="Tweet by Matthew Girard" src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/355x210_TwitterArticle/" style="border: 0px none ;" width="355px" height="210px" /></a></p>

<p>The format for the "spotlight" series isn't entirely nailed down yet so feel free to ask questions in the comments section and I'll follow-up with Matt after the fact if need be. That said, without further delay, Matt Girard from ITA Software, on Hudson.

My pleasure, glad to be a part of the community. We have been using Hudson in some form since early 2008. Predictably our usage has increased over time and now encompasses the majority of our automated build and test infrastructure.

Yes, though not to the degree that we have now. Prior to Hudson we were reliant on <a id="aptureLink_0DdF7ImGgA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuildBot">BuildBot</a> for our automated builds, but we were not doing continuous integration
 across our components until after the transition to Hudson. The easy to understand UI and flexibility were primary features that compelled our switch. I should mention
 that when we decided to switch we also evaluated <a id="aptureLink_3DDvWBrYei" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CruiseControl">CruiseControl</a> but Hudson came out on top for our needs.

<img src="/sites/default/files/itasoftware_tiny.png" alt="Matt @ ITA" /><br />
<strong>Matt</strong>

Our Hudson environments (yes, we have more than one) have been optimized for building C++, Java (all <a id="aptureLink_dkCKWMZxl1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Maven">maven</a> based), Lisp (a surprise to some to be sure <a href="http://itasoftware.com/careers/l_e_t_lisp.html?catid=8" target="_blank">more about that here</a>), and Python on Linux build slaves (Fedora and CentOS).

Our jobs are (loosely) grouped into one of three categories: rpm (we are primarily RedHat based), tests, and tools. The rpm jobs are the actual code builds and individual component unit tests. The test jobs (thank you <a id="aptureLink_ZDsnAh3cPt" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin">parameterized trigger plugin</a>!) are part of a larger cross-component integration testing and promotion scheme. The (handful of) tools jobs support us in tasks such as cleaning up stale sandbox database connections.

Given the flexibility of Hudson, it's safe to say that not everybody is using it in the exact same fashion, is there anything you would consider interesting or noteworthy about the use of Hudson at ITA?
</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top">
<img src="/sites/default/files/itasoftware_tiny.png" alt="Matt @ ITA" /><br />
<strong>Matt</strong>
</td><td>
I think that our most interesting usage of Hudson has to be how we have combined parameterized builds with the parameterized trigger plugin in order to do cross-component testing of trunk code. More specifically, we pass a properties file (to us a "scoreboard" that tells the jobs what exact revisions of which projects to
 test together) to several jobs and only build a final promotion job if ALL of downstream jobs (with the same scoreboard) passed. In this way we create a hurdle that all of our code must clear before we even consider deploying it anywhere else.


The next most interesting thing we are doing is using Hudson for continuous <em>deployment</em> of monitoring changes into our staging environment. It's quite rewarding to watch a check-in makes it's way through Hudson, into and rpm, and out to a server without a human being involved.

<strong>Matt</strong>

We evolved what became a very large build script (mostly derived from what we had for BuildBot) that handles all of the nitty-gritty details involved in the building, packaging, and testing of our software. Recently we have been working to refactor this into several smaller build tools each with a more focused purpose. The first of these is designed (largely as a wrapper to <a id="aptureLink_IpFANHwY8F" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM%20Package%20Manager">rpmbuild</a>) to standardize our package building while leaving the .spec files (with the real specifics) living alongside the code where they belong.

<strong>Matt</strong>

ITA is a decent size company and there is plenty of work that goes on that does not involve Hudson in any way. Still since we rely on the building and testing that Hudson does in order to promote new code to production, I would say that we are somewhere around an 8.

<p>I'd like to thank Matt again for being a good sport as the very first in what I hope will be a long line of "spotlights" on companies using Hudson to help them work smart, better and faster.

Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We all know that keeping important files in version control is critical, as it ensures problematic changes can be reverted and can serve as a backup mechanism as well. Code and resources are often kept in version control, but it can be easy to forget your continuous integration (CI) server itself! If a disk were to die or fall victim to a <a href="http://twitter.com/progrium/status/7646048501">misplaced</a> <code>rm -rf</code>, you could lose all the history and configuration associated with the jobs your CI server manages.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to create a repository, but it isn’t obvious which parts of your $HUDSON_HOME you’ll want to backup. You’ll also want to have some automation so new projects get added to the repository, and deleted ones get removed. Luckily we have a great tool to handle this: Hudson!</p>

<p>We have a Hudson job which runs nightly, performs the appropriate SVN commands, and checks in. The high-level overview of this job is basically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add any new jobs, users, plugin configurations, et cetera: <code>svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*</code></li>
  <li>Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists (such as a deleted job): <code>svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm</code></li>
  <li>Check it in! <code>svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration"</code>
You’ll want to make sure to use the <code>--non-interactive</code> option for any automated svn operations, as this ensures Subversion won’t hang asking a question but instead fail immediately. You may also need to provide your password with the <code>--password</code> option.</li>

<p>To make such a Hudson job, create a new job, tie it to the master (since this is where the configuration files are), set it to build periodically (we use “@midnight”), and add an “Execute shell” build step. Here’s the full script we use, to put into the build step:</p>

<p><code type="bash">
# Change into your HUDSON_HOME.
cd /opt/hudson
# Add any new conf files, jobs, users, and content.
svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*
# Ignore things in the root we don't care about.
echo -e "warnlogn*.logn*.tmpn*.oldn*.bakn*.jarn*.json" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores . &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Ignore things in jobs/* we don't care about.
echo -e "buildsnlast*nnext*n*.txtn*.lognworkspace*ncoberturanjavadocnhtmlreportsnncoverndoclinks" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores jobs/* &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists in Hudson.
svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm
# And finally, check in of course, showing status before and after for logging.
svn st &amp;&amp; svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration" &amp;&amp; svn st
</code></p>

<p>You’ll notice this does some extra things like set the svn:ignores property to provide a relatively clean <code>svn st</code> which it shows before and after the commit for logging purposes. One thing this job <em>doesn’t</em> do is put the build results of your jobs in version control. Because historical build logs and artifacts will never change and are also potentially large, a periodic (daily or weekly) <code>cp</code> or <code>rsync</code> of the <strong>jobs</strong> directory will still give you restorability while keeping your repository lean.</p>

<p>Now you can sleep well at night knowing that your CI server is safe and sound. If you are doing a similar thing with Hudson or another CI system, let us know about your solution!</p>

What's going on with the Hudson's infrastructure
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>A lot has changed in the Hudson development and distribution infrastructure since last summer - we've made a distinct effort to get the quality of our infrastructure to match the quality of Hudson itself. We owe a special thanks to the wonderful folks over at <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> - we're taking advantage of their generous <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/opensource/">open source license</a> for our bug tracking (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a>), wiki (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence<a>), and source repository browser (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/">FishEye</a>). Obviously, there's a lot more we can improve going forward - I'll have another post up soon, looking at some of the ideas we're kicking around. But for now, take a look at what we've already done, below the fold.
<!--break--></a></a></p>
<li>The Hudson war and plugin downloads have all moved off of the unreliable java.net to our own [hudson-ci.org](http://hudson-ci.org) with the downloads being powered by the same system used for distributing Java, OpenSolaris, and NetBeans. Downloading Hudson and/or plugins is now easier and more reliable.</li>
<li>We've moved issue tracking from java.net's system to our own JIRA instance, at [issues.hudson-ci.org](http://issues.hudson-ci.org). As with moving downloads off java.net, we've made reporting and browsing Hudson's issues much faster, easier and more reliable, while still using the same authentication on the back-end as our Subversion and Maven repositories. We're still working out some kinks in the system but since we're running our own issue tracker now, rather than using one we didn't have control over, we've got the flexibility we need to adapt our tools to best serve the developer and user communities.</li>
<li>Speaking of tools we now run ourselves, we've put up our own FishEye instance at [fisheye.hudson-ci.org](http://fisheye.hudson-ci.org) - until that was in place, we'd been relying on Atlassian's public FishEye instance, which has many other open source projects' repositories available. Getting our own server up means we don't have to bug the generous folks over at Atlassian every time the java.net SVN server confuses FishEye into failing to update. It also opens the door for us to use <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/">Crucible</a> for code review in the future.</li>
<li>Hudson's moved onto Twitter more and more over the last 6-9 months - we've got the always fabulous <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a>, tweeting new releases, Hudson-related tweets, and more, as well as the <a class="apturenoenhance" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23hudsonci">#hudsonci</a> hashtag.
<li>This may not strictly be infrastructure but it's worth mentioning that we've now got native packages and distribution for Hudson for <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/debian/">Ubuntu/Debian</a>, <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/redhat/">Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS</a>, <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/opensuse/">openSUSE</a>, <a href="http://pkg.hudson-ci.org/">OpenSolaris/Nevada</a>, and <a href="http://www.freshports.org/www/hudson/">FreeBSD</a>.</li>
<li>This is all in addition to key parts of our infrastructure that haven't changed: our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Home">official wiki</a>, our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">user and developer mailing lists</a>, our <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/">Subversion repository</a> (and a <a href="http://github.com/kohsuke/hudson/">Git mirror</a> on GitHub) and our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">IRC channel over on Freenode</a>.</li>

Oh, and I hear there's a blog now too.

Breaking! Hudson 1.345 Released!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As I mentioned in the footer of the post on the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-1344-released">Hudson 1.344 release</a>, there were a couple big regressions in the 1.344 release that were causing a number of users issues (such as <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5536">issue 5536</a> and <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5546">issue 5546</a>).</p>

<p>As a result, Kohsuke and the team have quickly pushed out a hot-fix release: 1.345. Here's the break down:</p>

<h4 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;</p>
<li class="major bug">
    Update center retrieval, "build now" link, and real-time console update was broken in 1.344.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5536">issue 5536</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Fixed the backward incompatibility introduced in HUDSON-5391 fix in 1.344.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5391">issue 5391</a>)




If you have already updated to 1.344, your "Update Center" is most likely busted and you'll need to download the `hudson.war` file manually.


You can go grab the [latest .war file](http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war) straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
