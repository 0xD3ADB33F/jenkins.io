Extreme Feedback Lamp, Switch Gear style

<p><br/>
This is a guest post by <a href="https://twitter.com/dvaske">Aske Olsson</a><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Extreme feedback is an incredibly powerful way to drive quality and accelerate your developer fast feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Having eXtreme Feedback Devices (XFDs) hooked up to your Jenkins jobs gives everyone on your team instant insight into the current software state. At customer after customer we've seen extreme feedback devices drive significant incremental productivity gains, so about a year ago we started talking about taking the concept mainstream and making it easily available to any development team. So, as a small side-project, we've decided to scratch our own itch and developed an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based, laser-cut, extreme feedback device, specifically designed for Jenkins. It infers a feeling of urgency when the build is broken, and a better sense of a achievement once the problem is fixed. Just connect the XFD to your network, install the "extreme feedback plugin" on your Jenkins server and configure which jobs to feedback extremely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
At the Jenkins Code Camp in Copenhagen today (with Kohsuke) we've made the lamp speak the name of the developer who broke the build :), improved the plugin's UI in Jenkins, and gotten the the lamp's display to list all the developers who contributed to the last change. Of course you can contribute too, just fork the repositories at <a href="https://github.com/switchgears/extremefeedbacklamp">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/switchgears/extreme-feedback-plugin">here</a> and create a pull request.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you're interested in trying out extreme feedback in your own team you can order <a href="http://www.gitgear.com/xfd">your own XFD lamp</a><br/>

Jenkins User Conference is back to California again!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Just like the last two years, this full day event packs talks from Jenkins developers and users, and it would be a great opportunity for Jenkins users to get to know each other and share their experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">The agenda is already posted</a>, covering everything from robotics to mobile developments, effective management of Jenkins instances to branching techniques. I'm personally looking forward to a number of talks from serious large-scale users, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">JUC Israel</a> was of any indication, it'd be a great opportunity to get feedback from people.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, we are moving the event to a weekday (Oct 23rd) to see if it helps or hurts the attendance. Similarly, the event is now in Palo Alto, as opposed to San Francisco. The site also happens to be a former Sun Microsystems headquarter, a place of some nostalgic value to me.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I am also very happy to see a number of active community members <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">signing up their employers to sponsor the event</a>. These will help us manage the cost of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So really, all that's needed is YOU! <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955">Please register for the event</a> (I believe the early bird price stays until this Friday), and looking forward to seeing you.

Jenkins comes with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting">the remoting library</a> that it uses to communicate between a master and slaves. This is a pretty awesome library, I think, which served us well.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the things this remoting layer does it to transfer the Java byte code on demand from the master to slaves on demand. This approach helps us keep slave deployment simple, as you don't have to keep the master and all the slaves in sync, but it also made the slave start-up slower, because none of the byte code loaded to slaves are kept around. It was all forgotten once the slave gets disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When slaves are static and stays online for hours, this wasn't a problem at all. But as more and more slaves become elastic (think EC2 or CloudBees DEV@cloud), This delay is becoming more and more noticeable. A similar issue happens when the Maven project type, which uses the same remoting library to talk to the running Maven build.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Another related performance bottleneck is the round-trip latency. When your slave is far away from a master, every classloading would incur a network round-trip, and it can add up quickly. This is because Java classloading abstraction is funamentally chatty.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jesse and I <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15120">started seriously thinking about this problem</a> last year, and we've <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/10">kept a branch going</a> to address this problem.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
After several trans-atlantic hacking during flights, we were finally able to release this in 1.519.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Starting this version, the remoting layer uses a local jar file cache to store jar files that were downloaded from the master. This pretty much eliminated the need to send class files over the wire.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In addition, the master will analyze class files as a slave request them and "push down" information about how related other classes should be loaded by the slave. This speculative "prefetching" saves the slave from making an expensive network round trip to the master.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In <a href="http://jenkins-ci.361315.n4.nabble.com/Efficient-class-jar-prefetching-in-remoting-td4665943.html">my benchmark using Maven builds, the prefetching cut the # of roundtrips to about half</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you do a lot of Maven builds, or if you have elastic slaves, we highly encourage you to upgrade.<br/>

Jenkins User Conference Israel Summary

<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">Jenkins User Conference in Israel</a> was held this year on a different venue than the last year, because we have grown! I believe Shlomi Ben-Haim of JFrog said in his opening speech that the attendance has grown more than 50%, despite the ticket price increase.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, the event was held at a former Kibbutz turned into an event facility. This was rather fit for Jenkins for both emphasizes the community. The auditorium was big, the sky was bright & clear, and it was a wonderful day. JFrog folks even made a few Jenkins drapes (that I eventually brought back with me, so expect to see them)<br/>

For me, talks like one from Haggai are more interesting, as it shows me how Jenkins works in a domain that I’m not familiar with (in this case, .NET). And if you are Jenkins users, there are all sorts of talks, ranging from talks on CLI/XML interface of Jenkins (stuff for those who are writing tools and scripts that interface with Jenkins) to how someone managed user interface automation testing with Jenkins. Another talk that I got hooked was a talk from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel-abstracts.cb#YardenaMeymann">Yardena Meymann</a> about the review board Jenkins plugin that she wrote that lets you test out code change under the review, much the same way <a href="http://buildhive.cloudbees.com/">BuildHive</a> or <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+pull+request+builder+plugin">GitHub pull request builder plugin</a> does it for GitHub pull requests, but for Subversion. I also liked the 45 minutes format better, which helps cut the fat and take people straight to the point.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Outside talks, Israeli people kept me busy! They cornered me on multiple occasions and we had a lot of interesting conversations, so much so that I missed about half the talks! I just wish we had coordinated this upfront so that I could have visited them while I was there. This also made me wonder what if we designate one corner of the site and did a series of birds-of-feather around specific topics. This led me to try <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/">Jenkins Scalability Summit</a> in the upcoming JUC Palo Alto.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-israel.cb">All the slides and videos are available</a>, if you want to take a look --- be forewarned that some of them are in Hebrew.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you aren’t in Israel but like the concept of JUC, looking forward to seeing you in the upcoming <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955">Jenkins User Conference in Palo Alto</a> this October.

Office hours this week: Git plugin refactoring
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This Wednesday's <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">Jenkins office hours</a> is all about the Git plugin refactoring that's going on.</p>

<div style="float:right; margin:1em">
<img width="250" src="http://git-scm.com/images/logos/2color-lightbg@2x.png" />
</div>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Git plugin</a> is one of the most popular plugins out there, and it's been around for quite some time. Combine that with the fact that there are so many different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.</p>

<p>As early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London, and I've made a steadily progress since then and I'm ready for a wider review.</p>

<p>So we'll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I'll show you how the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it'll enable us in the future.</p>

<p>If the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what's cooking, please join us in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">the office hours</a> on Google Hangout.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you!</p>

Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH slaves
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
As the usage of Jenkins expands, we started seeing users who run multiple 100s of slaves on one master, and thus it became a lot more important for us to scale well to even larger number of slaves.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While I was looking at the thread dump of a large system, I started noticing that there are a large number of threads lying around pumping <tt>InputStream</tt> and writing to another <tt>OutputStream</tt>. On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So this morning, I tackled one source of such waste.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins has <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the ability to launch slave on a remote server via SSH</a> for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2">pure-Java implementation of SSH client</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 slaves connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you run a lot of slaves, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the SSH slaves plugin</a> to take advantages of this!<br/>
