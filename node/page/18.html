Reducing the # of threads in Jenkins: SSH slaves
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
As the usage of Jenkins expands, we started seeing users who run multiple 100s of slaves on one master, and thus it became a lot more important for us to scale well to even larger number of slaves.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While I was looking at the thread dump of a large system, I started noticing that there are a large number of threads lying around pumping <tt>InputStream</tt> and writing to another <tt>OutputStream</tt>. On Linux, each thread occupies 2MB just for its stack size, so if we can eliminate some of them, it'd be a good saving.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So this morning, I tackled one source of such waste.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins has <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the ability to launch slave on a remote server via SSH</a> for the longest time, and to simplify this, we've been using a <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2">pure-Java implementation of SSH client</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To cut the long story short, I was able to eliminate two pump threads per every SSH connection. Furthermore, when it runs on the upcoming Jenkins 1.521, it'll save one more thread per every SSH connection. So if you have 100 slaves connected through SSH, this alone saves up 600MB of memory. That's pretty good for a few hours work!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you run a lot of slaves, be sure to pick up version 0.27 of <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SSH+Slaves+plugin">the SSH slaves plugin</a> to take advantages of this!<br/>

Giving Back to the Community:  3 Ways to Keep Jenkins Growing
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
With more than 600 plugins, Jenkins has a vibrant community and we're dependent on YOU to keep it that way. Here are 3 ways you can give back to the community to ensure that everyone benefits and Jenkins keeps growing...<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #1: vendor+community=win</h3><br/>
Jenkins is becoming ubiquitous enough that tool vendors and service providers often find their users asking them to provide Jenkins plugins. The challenge for these companies is that they don’t necessarily possess the necessary Jenkins expertise to do one.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Here at the Jenkins project, what we are trying to do is to work with these people to deliver a plugin. It gets the job done a whole lot more quickly if the vendor brings in their expertise on their tool/services and we bring in our expertise on Jenkins plugin development.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
For example, we recently worked with <a href="http://www.soasta.com/press-releases/soasta-and-cloudbees-partner-to-deliver-first-jenkins-plugin-for-continuous-integration-on-mobile-platforms/">SOASTA</a> to help them open-source the plugin they developed in house, then help them add a whole bunch of new functionalities. By open-sourcing a plugin in the Jenkins project, vendors win as the community helps fix bugs and improve plugins.  The Jenkins project wins by building relationship with vendors. And finally the users win by having more integrations.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So the next time you ask your vendor to provide a Jenkins integration, please tell them to drop us a note, and we are happy to talk.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #2: scratch your itch and take credit</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
If you are working for a company and hacking some Jenkins plugins for your team, then you should definitely consider contributing those changes back. Let’s take <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/11/22/sony-contributes-to-jenkins-software-tool/">Robert and Tomas</a> for example, who contributed a number of significant plugins from Sony Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><br/>
The company wins, because it shows off their technical excellence. Plus the flexibility to let engineers work on these OSS projects helps them retain and attract high-caliber developers. It also lets the community shoulder some of the burdens of maintaining plugins.<br/>
<li><br/>
You win, because now you have more things to show to future employers. After all, <a href="http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume">GitHub is your new resume</a>! And when you aren’t sure how to go about implementing a feature or fixing a bug, open-sourcing your plugin lets us jump in and get you unstuck.<br/>
<li><br/>
The community wins, thanks to your new awesome plugin.<br/>
<li><br/>
Besides all of those pragmatic reasons, when you share something with others and they tell you how much it helped them, even if it’s just one or two people, it’s a deeply moving experience.<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It just has so many advantages, it’s a no brainer!<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Giving it back to the community #3: contribute by proxy</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
If you are working for a company, wanting to see particular features/integrations in Jenkins but don’t have time to do it yourself, there’s yet another way, and that’s to contribute by proxy.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The idea is that you contract with those who already know how to develop Jenkins plugins, and you have them produce/improve Jenkins plugins in open-source. <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Praqma">Praqma</a> is a great example of one such company. They are well connected in the community, with lots of experience under their belts, and your company takes the credit for the work. There are also a number of individuals who can do this for you.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Why give it away something for free when you paid for it, you might ask. That’s because the code sitting in house rots when it’s not maintained by anybody. In contrast, when the rest of the world can hack on your code, you get occasional random bug fixes by strangers (the worst case), and sometimes it gets its own life (the best case.)<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If this way of giving back suits you better, feel free to send an e-mail to <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">the dev list</a>.

<p>This year, the West Coast Jenkins User Conference will be in Palo Alto rather than San Francisco. If you’re nearby – or even if you’re not – join Kohsuke and other fellow developers for a solid day of Jenkins.</p>

<ul>
  <li> The Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2013  </li>
  <li> The Venue: <a href="http://www.paloaltojcc.org/">Palo Alto Jewish Community Center </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc/juc-2013.cb">Details  </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6367028955">Register </a>  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc/juc-2013.cb">Call for Papers</a> is open until June 9 (scroll to bottom of page for form). JUC will be much better with your involvement, so please submit your abstracts and share your Jenkins knowledge with the community.</p>

<p>&lt;div align=center&gt;
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXEbFfAeymw?rel=0?autoplay=1&amp;rel=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showsearch=0" rel="lightvideo[width=640px;height:360px;]" class="lightbox-processed" target="_blank" onclick="javascript: trackEvent('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXEbFfAeymw?rel=0?autoplay=1&amp;rel=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showsearch=0','Outbound Link','Click');"><img alt="Kohsuke Kawaguchi – Keynote Address, JUC San Francisco" src="http://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/Kohsuke-Kawaguchi-Opening-San-Fran-Thumbnail.png " title="Kohsuke Kawaguchi – Keynote Address, JUC San Francisco" /></a>
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>A very special thanks to our JUC Palo Alto sponsors, who will make sure you are fed, caffeinated, clothed (in this year’s collectible Jenkins tshirt), and generally well cared for at the conference: <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a>, <a href="http://www.jfrog.com">JFrog</a>, <a href="http://www.xebialabs.com">XebiaLabs</a>, <a href="http://www.appvance.com">appvance</a>, <a href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com">ZeroTurnaround</a>, <a href="http://www.lmitsoftware.com">LMIT Software</a>, <a href="http://www.blackdiamond.com">Black Diamond Software</a>, <a href="http://www.newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, <a href="http://www.liferay.com">Liferay</a>, <a href="http://www.appdynamics.com">AppDynamics</a>, and <a href="http://www.soasta.com">SOASTA</a>.</p>

<p>Two other differences this year – the conference is not timed to coincide with JavaOne, and it falls on a Wednesday rather than a Sunday. We thought we’d try these changes and are interested to know if they work better for everyone.</p>

<p>The agenda won’t be populated until after the Call for Papers closes and talks are selected. But you can check out previous JUC agendas, slides, and video:</p>

<br/>
<p><br/>
It's been a while we had a hackathon in Germany. Let's get together, get some coding done, and get to know fellow Jenkins developers! The date is June 15th Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
TNG Technology Consulting, where <a href="https://github.com/wolfs">Stefan Wolf</a> (dependency graph viewer plugin, etc) works, will be hosting us (thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We'll try to arrange some themes or agenda, based on who's coming and how many of us will be there. For example,<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li> If there are many people who have never done a plugin development, we can do a plugin development tutorial.<br/>
<li> If we see a concentration of devs in a specific area of Jenkins (say mobile), we can try some focused development in a specific area.<br/>
<li> If you have things you need from the core to do what you want, this is the chance to get that implemented on the spot!<br/>
<li> If you want to see a certain development happen in Jenkins but don't know how, please make a pitch to us in the form of presentations (short or long) would be welcome<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Finally, assuming there's interest, we'll head out somewhere for a dinner afterward.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are interested in coming, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/116074032/">please RSVP at meetup.com</a> so that we can prepare accordingly.

<br/>
<p><br/>
As recently exemplified by several reports on this blog, automation tools such as continuous integration servers, that help to defuse the exploding complexity of software under the ever-increasing pressure to deliver, are steadily gaining well-deserved mindshare in the industry. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
However, it is not just developers of enterprise software who need solutions to the complexity problem. Scientists are arguably even worse off: most of them are not trained as software engineers, yet, in the last decades, creating custom software has become an integral part of virtually any research activity, be it data analysis, simulation or experiments. Frequently, there is a great emphasis on numerical accuracy and reproducibility of results, which requires extensive testing. As a coup de grâce, most publicly funded research projects are running on tight budgets, excluding the possibility of hiring professional contractors to outsource required software development work.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Enter Jenkins the Butler!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Back in 2011, Yury V. Zaytsev, a doctoral candidate now working at Jülich Research Center, Germany was supported by a Google Summer of Code stipend to design a continuous integration infrastructure for <a href="http://www.nest-initiative.org">NEST</a>, a spiking neuronal network simulator for neuroscientific research released under the GPL license. An overwhelmingly positive experience with this new setup motivated him to write up <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00031/abstract">a case study</a>, which was recently published in "Frontiers in Neuroinformatics", an open access scientific journal.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
"The new CI system boosts our productivity, because it helps us find and fix breakages very quickly, even when they only occur for obscure combinations of configuration options. Automated integration testing is a major breakthrough for NEST, as it ensures that developing new features does not come at the cost of reliability or accuracy" - said Markus Diesmann, director of the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) at the Jülich Research Center, Germany and NEST Initiative board member.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We hope that through a peer-reviewed publication in a prominent scientific journal we will be able to reach the scientific community more efficiently, as compared to the materials targeting professional software developers. However, we likewise believe that our case study might be of interest to the readers of this blog, especially those who are still only considering implementing continuous integration.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Lastly, we would like to thank all developers and users of Jenkins whose contributions throughout the years made it the versatile and robust continuous integration server it is today!
