What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation
virtually any project

Jenkins User Conference Paris Summary
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris.cb">The first stop of Jenkins User Conference world tour</a> this year was Paris, where there's a considerable concentraion of Jenkins developers and users (sometiems those of us on the other side of the Atlantic call them "the French gang") The event was held a day before Devoxx France, in the hope that we attract more attendance.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/62/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423115916-5ed0a69e.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I believe there are 100+ people that actually showed up, and we had a full day divided in two tracks, talking all things about Jenkins. While many are French, some of the attendees come from all over the Europe. I was able to see some familiar faces, as well as those who I've only known by their names.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I tried to get in and out of both tracks to get the sense of what's going on, so that I can report them later, and here's my notes.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/75/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423121146-816f0806.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I kicked off the whole day with a keynote, looking back what we've done since we became Jenkins. I've looked into various activities in the community, such as LTS, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby">Ruby plugin development</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements">UI enhancements</a>. I updated my adoption statistics slides (we are happy to report that we crossed <a href="http://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html">40K installations</a> in our tracking), and reported that JFrog is now <a href="http://java.dzone.com/announcements/jenkins-ci-and-jfrog-announce">hosting our repositories</a> that we rely on for the development. I showed some of what we've been lately working on at CloudBees &mdash; such as the upcoming version of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb">Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees</a> that support high-availability, <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/press-room/cloudbees-donates-five-plugins-jenkins-community.cb">our giving away the folder plugin for free</a> (as in beer), and previews of some not quite public yet features, which is a treat only for those who came!<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/89/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123054-9f4acaef.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In the first slot, <a href="http://twitter.com/gboissinot/">Gregory Boissinot</a> went through a plugin development workshop. This was actually something I really wanted to understand, so that I get the objective view on where the pitfalls are. Even though the talk was in French, I did understand the code he was showing, and I took some notes about having some kind of skeleton code generator &mdash; for example, there's a common pattern for building an UI bound model object (for asking the user to enter data that has structures, persisting them, and so on), and having a code generator command line tool (like <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.rb">jenkins.rb</a> has) could be really handy.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/93/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423123825-9ef5019f.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In another room, <a href="http://twitter.com/ndeloof">Nicolas</a> and Mathieu were showing their <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin">"build flow"</a> plugin, which lets you write a workflow in Groovy DSL. Choreographing a complex workflow that involves multiple jobs is a commoon challenge among any Jenkins users, and so this talk was well attended, and I'm really looking forward to seeing this plugin mature (there's <a href="https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=MC&rID=60616172&rKey=7caa63dde29ef758">a separate effort</a> to integrate BPMN workflow into Jenkins, see more about that here.) One thing I learned about Groovy DSL since then is the AST transformation. I'm thinking it might allow us to convert the DSL workflow script into a continuation passing style so that you can suspend/resume workflow at arbitrary point.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/106/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423125816-eb3613bb.jpg"></a><br/>
 </div><br/>
 <br/>
<p><br/>
The day was so packed that we didn't even waste the lunch time! While attendees are eating, we had lightening talks in the room. Olivier showed off how Apache runs Jenkins, which is quite sizable, then I pitched in for <a href="http://twitter.com/4imod">Domonik</a>, who couldn't make it to the conference, and covered the scriptler plugin. Vincent followed and covered the similar Groovy system console. Harpreet then closed off the lunch lightening talks by showing the templates plugin in Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/111/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423130341-35bbfbae.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In the afternoon, <a href="http://twitter.com/aheritier">Arnaud</a>, one of our French gangs, showed how you can set up the iOS development on Jenkins (from code change to test to the delivery of the binaries to actual phones.) Bruno then did a demo of how he uses DEV@cloud and RUN@cloud to quickly set up continuous deployment for Java webapps. For system integraters that deal with lots of projects, I think it is a great combination (for example allowing you to hand over the entire development environment to the customer when the project is over.)<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/140/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423133439-5a7b4fbe.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
While all that is going on in one room, in another room Lars Kruse showed off how the old meets the new &mdash; where you <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ClearCase+UCM+Plugin">take ClearCase UCM and use it to do validated merge</a>, in which only the changes tested by Jenkins become visible to the rest of the team. I personally don't know much about ClearCase, but it was very interesting that emerging techniques like validated merge can be applied on more traditional SCM tools. He also said his company works with clients to develop custom Jenkins plugins. I always felt that any big company adopting Jenkins need some custom glue plugins, and I regularly come across those companies, but CloudBees can only help so many. It's great to see that there are more help available now!<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/188/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423164957-bae4f4ad.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<p><br/>
The talk that followed was from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jcarsique">Julien Carsique</a> from Nuxeo, discussing how he manages and improves the CI environment for his organization. Now, I regret I didn't take all the notes about details, but I think this was one of the best presentations of the day for me. I remember thinking that if we had the best Jenkins administrator award for those who push things to the limit and beyond, he would be my top pick. IIRC, he had a major Maven projects that span across different repos and all. He set up Jenkins such that any change triggers a cascade of new builds of downstream jobs, which later then fan out to cross-platform test jobs, then he made the whole thing visualized so you can track exactly where the time is spent and how those changes propagate. I think this was very inspirational to many other fellow Jenkins users, and I hope he will put his slides somewhere so that other people can mimic what he's done.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/144/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423134050-8dd4dca8.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<p><br/>
Back to the big room, my fellow colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/connolly_s">Stephen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/singh_harpreet">Harpreet</a> did the only introductory talk in the whole day, going through check lists of production Jenkins deployments, recapping why you want CI, etc. (And I always forget that there are still many who don't know much about Jenkins!)<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/156/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423135955-e072a9a0.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It was also great to see and hear <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</a>, the guy behind <a href="http://jenkins-php.org/">Jenkins PHP</a>, talk about Jenkins and PHP integrations. I wish we had more of those people who bridge our community to different communities and help us spread the ideas. He even kindly gave me his Jenkins/PHP book and signed it for me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
  <a href="http://photo.kohsuke.org/picture.php?/159/category/2"><img src="http://photo.kohsuke.org/upload/2012/04/23/thumbnail/TN-20120423140457-1e3a42c8.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<p><br/>
Aside from talks, food was great, especially for those of us who came from the U.S. I've got some good inspirations about where we need to work. And I also managed to implement the search filter in the update center during the day, in response to the valid complaint from Sebastian. For virtual communities like ours, it's really good to meet people in the meat space and put faces on names. Build automation engineers are often somewhat lonely in their respective organizations &mdash; there just aren't that many people who get excited about automating things away, and so having so many of like-minded folks in one room was by itself a great experience.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
On the things to improve side, I felt that workshops was tricky to do in a limited time and in a big room. Maybe it would work out better if there's a smaller room where smaller number of people can gather and hack away (probably some time slots designated for some specific topics), then we can collectively merge pending important pull requests, teaching how to develop plugins, or ask others to look at their plugins, etc. There also can be a valid discussion about JUC, run nicely in exchange of admission fee, vs JUC run cheaply but free.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In any case, I think the quality of presentations were very good, and knowing local Jenkins developers/users would help expand your horizon. As I said in the beginning, we are takin JUC around the world this year. <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb">The one in New York</a> is just in the next week, followed by Herzelia (Israel), Tokyo, San Francisco, and Antwerp. Please <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb">register while seats are still available</a>!<br/>

Announcing the Jenkins CIA
</a>

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/jenkinsCIA.jpg" alt="Agent L. Jenkins" align="right" /></p>

<p>For years, we've been hearing about <em>covert</em> installations of Jenkins by groups
of developers within larger companies. Rogue engineers, frustrated by the lack
of continuous integration would download <code>jenkins.war</code> and run it off their
workstation. As time went on, word-of-mouth within the organization spread
Jenkins far and wide.</p>

<p>Today we announce an initiative to help support these rogue agents: the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA</a>. CIA being short for Continuous
Integration Ambassador of course.</p>

<p>If you're going to be speaking at a JUG or another event where you will have
the opportunity to promote and teach people about Jenkins, you too can join the
CIA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send us an email telling us about the event and how many people you expect</li>
  <li>Write us a guest blog post ahead of time, talking about the event</li>
  <li>We dispatch Jenkins stickers and a CIA Agent shirt for you to wear.</li>
  <li>Write up a summary blog post about the event afterwards</li>
  <li>Repeat!</li>
</ul>

<p>In the coming months, we'll start collaborating and creating standard
presentations that can be easily re-used to introduce people not only to
Jenkins, but continuous integration in general, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>If you're not the speaking type but instead prefer to work behind the scenes,
you can join the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services">OSS</a> by checking out the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing">Beginner's Guide to contributing

<a href='/blog/2012/03/13/why-does-jenkins-have-blue-balls/'>
Why does Jenkins have blue balls?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/japanese-traffic-light.png" align="right" alt="A japanese traffic light" /> It is interesting having an open source project that is sufficiently old to start generating "lore" of some form or another. Jenkins is starting to get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.</p>

<p>One of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins' use of "blue balls" to indicate success by default. This is enough of an "issue" for some users that the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Green+Balls">Green Balls</a> plugin is in the <a href="http://imod.github.com/jenkins-stats/svg/201201-top-plugins1000.svg">list of top 10 installed plugins</a>.</p>

<p>The reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke's</a> Japanese upbringing. The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled "s/blue/green/g" (<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-369">JENKINS-369</a>):</p>

<p>This response Kohsuke cited was taken <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ParthenonWeekly/message/232">from this Q&amp;A thread</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q.</strong> "<em>Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when they are really green?</em>" –Question submitted by John Sypal</p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries of Everyday
Life Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first traffic
signals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic lights is a holdover from those days.</p>

  <p>This sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like
cucumbers, spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This
is because historically, Japanese people considered green to be a
shade of blue. For example, the Chinese character for blue,
pronounced ao is made up of two characters, iki (life) and i (well)
and refers to the colour of plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese people say it means blue.</p>

  <p>Japanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours: red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.</p>

  <p>In another interesting cultural difference relating
to colour, Japanese children always colour the sun red instead of
yellow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<em>here's a <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-369?focusedCommentId=120769&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-120769">direct link to Kohsuke's comment</a></em>)</p>

<p>Unfortunately it's not for color blind users, although that's a pretty convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means stop and blue means go!</p>

<p>With the <a href="/content/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris">JUC Paris 2012</a> call for papers open, it's important to mention that we are also looking for <strong>sponsors</strong> for the various Jenkins User Conferences that are being planned around the world right now!</p>

<p>Currently there are four conferences being put together right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris.cb">JUC Paris</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb">JUC New York</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">JUC San Francisco</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-antwerp.cb">JUC Antwerp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your company is heavily invested in Jenkins or interested in reaching the kind of audience that will be at a JUC (highly technical, motivated) then you should consider becoming a sponsor one of these conferences (link below)!</p>

FOSDEM 2012 Recap
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>(<strong>Editor's note:</strong> <em>Apologies for the delay in getting this wrap-up out, it's been quite a busy month!</em>)</p>

<p>This year has already been full of milestones, the first of which being our <a href="/content/happy-birthday-jenkins">first birthday</a> as an open source project. The second major milestone for the project was that we went to <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2012/">FOSDEM 2012</a>, arguably the largest volunteer-organized and operated open source conference on the planet.</p>

<p>We had a couple of things going on at FOSDEM that merit a mention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Jenkins project had a stand in the K building, the same building where the Free Java, Config and Systems Management, and a few other pertinent dev rooms were located</li>
  <li>The Jenkins project gave away 2 free copies of <a href="https://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Smart's</a> book: "<a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide">Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a>" (thanks to O'Reilly!)</li>
  <li>Community member <a href="https://github.com/rtyler/">R. Tyler Croy</a> gave <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/10/fosdem-slides.html">a talk</a> on running the Jenkins project infrastructure with <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki">Puppet</a></li>
  <li>The O'Reilly folks brought 10+ Jenkins books to sell at their stand.</li>
  <li>Project founder <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> and a number of project members held a constructive <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+UI+Enhancement+discussion+notes">UI Enhancements discussion</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were very fortunate to have <em>so many</em> Jenkins contributors in attendance, who all helped with the Jenkins stand, introducing people to Jenkins and much more.</p>

  <p>FOSDEM was for me an opportunity to meet other Jenkins contributors I only knew by IRC nickname. Those two days were awesome to discuss with users on our stand, joke and socialize, as well as having some more technical debates and encourage folks to get involved in the community. Even I couldn't attend the talks I selected on the conference agenda due to room being full, I really enjoyed this 100% geek weekend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The people, the talks, the social events, the sheer size of FOSDEM all make for a pretty inspiring weekend.  And incredibly, it's all for free.</p>

  <p>You can not help but feel motivated after attending.  You always learn something new, discover myriad projects – in niches you never knew existed – and talk to smart folk from all over.</p>

  <p>Talking to people at the Jenkins stand was no different.  Though in a striking number of cases, people <em>had</em> already heard of Jenkins, were big fans and took a clutch of stickers back home for their colleagues.</p>

  <p>Speaking with those who weren't yet using Jenkins was equally                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <br />
interesting. My favourite was talking to one guy who described a                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <br />
particularly complex workflow; at each step he asked if Jenkins could do it, and I was able to cheerily reply "yes" to every single one.</p>

  <p>Getting to put faces to names of Jenkins developers was also a huge plus, and resulted in numerous great conversations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was great to get some faces to the short names on IRC. Talking to other commiters was awesome, I thought they are cool before I went to FOSDEM, but now I know!</p>

  <p>Its was great to talk to people who are using the tools you are working on, there where so many just coming up to say thank you! (?and there where/are by far more then I thought!)
I know I'm standing on the shoulders of a giant - but I also do feel that my commitment is of value for others too.</p>

  <p>Feels great to be part of this community!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent so much time at the stand telling people about Jenkins or showing them, that I only ended up seeing a couple actual sessions the whole weekend.
The kinds of people who came to talk to us almost entirely developers of one kind or another, which was really great to talk about how Jenkins can be used effectively for Perl shops, for Python, C++, C#, Java (of course) or even for deployment automation. The spread was a pretty big endorsement, I think, of the extensible nature of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.
In planning for FOSDEM I had urged Kohsuke to order <em>thousands</em> of stickers for the event, and when all was said and done I think we had given away around 1000 stickers to new Jenkins fans, old Jenkins fans and a few folks in the community who were looking forward to going back to their local JUG to share.</p>

  <p>I'm looking forward to making the trip to the bitter cold of Brussels in February again next year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FOSDEM had lots of interesting talks and was very well organized (from my point of view) and best of all… it's free! Apart from the talks and nice lineup of speakers, it has been a great opportunity to meet people. People I already knew, some in person, some only from IRC, the mailing list, or as a maintainer of a plugin; but also people thatcame up to the Jenkins stand.</p>

  <p>From the people that I talked to:
- 60% knew Jenkins and use it every day ("Yeah, I know Jenkins. The whole company uses it and nothing works without it!")
- 35% had heard of it or were very interested ("I know Jenkins, but we bought the Atlassian package and now we have to use Bamboo, Jira and Confluence." [me mentioning the Jira integration of Jenkins] "Wow, I really have to try that out and convince our team to switch to Jenkins!".
- 5% Weirdos and WTF!? (<em>disgusted</em> "Is this another one of these                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <br />
projects funded by Red Hat? They fund everything!")</p>

  <p>Meeting Tom Huybrechts without knowing it (at first) was a big                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br />
suprise. He has created or contributed to some of the best plugins                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br />
(eg. the parameterized-trigger plugin) and I see his name at least                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br />
once whenever I browse through core source code. During the impromptu UI enhancement meetings he showed us another three plugins that he wrote but never made public just because he doesn't have time to support them all.</p>

  <p>Then at the stand he casually mentioned that he is administering                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <br />
around 3000 jobs on 100+ build machines. At the same time he seems                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br />
like a very humble and low key character.</p>

  <p>To sum it up, the best thing about an open source project like Jenkins is the community. Working together with nice people from all over the world to create the best CI server has been a great experience. The FOSDEM weekend was another event that proved that.
I'll definitely come back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FOSDEM is one of the few conferences that has a distinctive hand-made geek-for-geek feeling to it. No marketing people, no bullshit flyers, but lots of technical folks and good beer. I really enjoyed talking to users, as always, but above all I was very happy to see developers and project members in the Jenkins community come out in full force, and I felt they enjoyed it just as much. I'm really hoping that we'll now keep this going for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it's safe to assume we'll be back next year for <strong>FOSDEM 2013</strong>, hope to see you there!</p>

Après le succès de la <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb">  Jenkins User Conference l’an dernier à San Francisco</a> et à l’intérêt qu’elle a soulevé, nous organisons cette année la JUC dans quatre grande villes à travers le monde. La premiére étape de cette tournée est la <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb">JUC 2012 à Paris</a>, le 17 avril. La conférence aura lieu la veille de <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/Accueil">Devoxx France</a> dans les mêmes locaux. La date a été spécialement choisie pour que vous puissiez faire d’une pierre deux coups, ou plutôt deux confs !<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Les <a href="http://cloudbees-jenkins-user-confs.eventbrite.com/">inscriptions sont ouvertes</a>. Inscrivez-vous dès maintenant pour bénéficier de la réduction réservée au plus enthousiastes. Vous pouvez également <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">proposer un sujet</a> ou bien <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-sponsorship.cb">soutenir la conférence en tant que sponsor</a>. Comme il est bien connu que les Français aiment voir leurs compatriotes sur scène, j’espère que nos nombreux développeurs jenkins francophones (les meilleurs, soit dit en passant) proposeront un sujet !<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Cette année, nous demandons une contribution pour les inscriptions (avec un tarif réduit avant le 18 février), afin de couvrir les frais d’organisation, mais nous vous offrirons en contrepartie le T-shirt officiel ainsi que des autocollants Jenkins. Si on se base sur la JUC 2011, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-scale-10x-los-angeles">SCALE 10x</a>, ou le <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM</a>, ce sera une opporunité exceptionnelle pour rencontrer et discuter avec les dévelopeurs majeurs du coeur ou des plugins, ainsi que les nombreux utilisateurs prêts à partager leur expérience et à répondre à toutes vos questions.<br/>

Thanks to the success of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb"> the  Jenkins User Conference last year at San Francisco</a> and high interest, this year we are bringing JUC to 4 cities around the world. And the first stop is <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb">JUC 2012 in Paris</a>, on April 17. This is one day before <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/Accueil">Devoxx France</a>, and in the same venue. The date is specifically chosen so that you can kill two conferences in one stone!<br/>
<br/>
Register for JUC Paris now (http://www.cloudbees.com/juc2012.cb) and get the Early Bird discount - which is a significant reduction in the registration fee! The conference is <a href="http://cloudbees-jenkins-user-confs.eventbrite.com/">accepting registrations</a> as well as looking for <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">talk submissions</a> and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-sponsorship.cb">sponsors</a>. I get the impression that French people like other fellow French speaking, so I hope our French-speaking plugin developers will submit talks.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, we are charging a small amount of money in the hope of covering the expense, but we'll give out T-shirts (which were really hot last year!) as well as stickers. And if the experience at JUC 2011, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-scale-10x-los-angeles">SCALE 10x</a>, and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM</a> was any indication, this is a great opportunity to meet and talk with plugin/core developers, and other fellow users with whom you can discuss your experience/questions.<br/>
