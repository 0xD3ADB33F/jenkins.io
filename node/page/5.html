Upcoming office hour on Workflow
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jglick/">Jesse Glick</a> will host the next office hour <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&amp;iso=20150812T11&amp;p1=283&amp;ah=1">this Wednesday, 11 AM PDT</a> on <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin#introduction">Workflow</a>.</p>

<p>Workflow has been Jesse's project for the last year or so. If you don't know what Workflow is, check out these talks about it from past JUCes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/event/topic/workflow-jenkins">June 2014</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/event/topic/workflow-jenkins-0">October 2014</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-east/01-02-1400-glick">June 2015</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This will be a developer-focused session on integrating with Workflow. He'll discuss things like how to make sure your plugin can be used as part of workflows, and best practices for extending the workflow DSL. There's already been a session on Workflow in January, but Jesse hasn't been idle, and there's new stuff to share.</p>

<p><h3>Mobile is Joining the Party At This Year’s Jenkins User Conference</h3></p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Consider this as a shout out to mobile app developers: You are invited! For the first time, there’s a mobile track at this year’s Jenkins User Conference to discuss the best ways to extend CI/CD to mobile application testing.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>As agile practices take hold, enterprises are expecting more collaboration between dev and test teams. Dev teams are doing more testing while QA teams are becoming more skilled at coding. This is happening now, and as a result open-source test automation frameworks like Selenium and Appium are flourishing. At the same time, CI/CD adoption is growing. This is happening more so for web development rather than mobile. It’s no secret that incorporating mobile test automation and CI comes with challenges. Mobile UI testing on real devices is still a manual process for many organizations. Manual testing is perhaps a path of least resistance, but it also commits teams to the longest delivery path.  Some argue they lack the environment, resources or skilled people to create test automation. While the argument rages, its clear other teams are solving the challenge.  Teams are prioritizing the requirement to build a test framework and aligning disparate tools into an effective CI workflow.  Recent webinars with <a href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/ni/support/resources/webinars/test-automation-works-for-paychex">Paychex</a> and <a href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/ni/support/resources/webinars/journey-devops-replay">RaboBank</a> demonstrate CI/CD best practices can effectively extend to mobile app programs using real devices.  Particularly when the lab is moved to the cloud and teams can focus on building robust test automation suites.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>But overall, the transition to an agile SDLC for mobile apps is happening too slowly. Yet the mobile market demands constant updates. An essential part of an agile SDLC is utilizing automated testing and continuous integration. To test builds using a CI server requires automation which is key to agile development in a fast-paced mobile world because it allows testing to be done by developers early in the lifecycle.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Extending CI to mobile programs is easy with Perfecto Mobile’s support for open source frameworks such as Selenium Remote Web Driver, <a href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/Company/Media_Room/PRs/perfecto-makes-appium-enterprise-grade">Appium</a> and Calabash where existing CI plugins are available. Support for commercial tools like HP UFT is also available.  With the <a href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/integrations/jenkins">Perfecto Mobile Jenkins Plugin</a>, you can perform automated functional testing every build. The result is obvious, discover defects earlier, deliver faster feedback and increase release frequency and, ultimately, have better performing apps.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Learn more about extending your CI practice to mobile projects in our  upcoming JUC mobile session: <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-03-1130">“Fast Feedback: Jenkins and Functional Mobile App Testing Without Pulling Your Hair Out.”</a> The session will share suggested coding practices along with planning guidance on maximizing the quality coverage during daily, nightly and weekly builds.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The Jenkins User Conference US West takes place in Santa Clara, CA on Sep 2-3, 2015.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Stop by the Perfecto Mobile booth and share your story.</p><br/>

Wiki and issue tracker outage over the weekend
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As you may have noticed, our wiki and issue tracker were unavailable from Thursday to Sunday last week. What happened?</p>

<p>We host parts of our infrastructure at the Open Source Lab at Oregon State (OSUOSL), including the databases for these two services. So far, there's no post mortem by OSUOSL (they expect to post one later this week), so we need to piece together what we know.</p>

<p>The databases for the wiki and issue tracker became <a href="https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/626903003203637248">inaccessible around midnight/12 AM Thu/Fri night</a> (all times UTC). Due to the large number and size of databases on that server, <a href="https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/626946293663821824">pulling from backups</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/627027620845129729">restoring from backup</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/osuosl/status/627237502420561920">replaying the binlogs</a> took them quite a while. During that time, we put up a maintenance screen on the wiki (and messed up the one for Jira, so there were connection timeouts instead).</p>

<p>The databases were back around 3 AM on Sunday. We disabled the maintenance screens around 6 PM later that day.</p>

<p>While this was a rather lengthy outage, it could have been much worse. We lost none of the data, after all. We thank the OSUOSL team for their efforts getting everything back up over the weekend!</p>

</dd><br/>
</dl><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The agenda is:</p><br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Determine the date for the first meet up</li><br/>
<li>Speakers for the second slot. Kohsuke will be presenting first.</li><br/>

Reinforcements for the Subversion Plugin
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><em>This is a guest post by Manuel Recena Soto (aka recena).</em></p>

<p>Users of the plug-in know that it has undergone <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Subversion+Plugin#SubversionPlugin-ChangeLog">very important changes</a> in the last two years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some of these changes resulted in regressions for some users that weren’t properly addressed in subsequent releases. Many users were therefore forced to keep using an older release of the plugin to keep their instances running.</p>

<p>To fix this difficult situation I've decided to dedicate my spare time to improving the plug-in and attempting to restore the stability that an essential plug-in like this requires.</p>

<p>In order to do so, <a href="https://github.com/recena/">me</a>, my colleague <a href="https://github.com/christ66">Steven Christou</a> and other members of the community have drawn up a plan.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks we will be focusing our efforts on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going through the Jira tickets
    <ul>
      <li>Checking whether they are duplicated</li>
      <li>Checking whether they are still relevant</li>
      <li>Asking for more information from the people who reported them</li>
      <li>Establishing their priority</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
  <li>Investigating bug reports and try to reproduce them</li>
  <li>Fixing serious bugs</li>
  <li>Refactoring the plugin to improve its maintainability.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re planning to publish a new 2.5.x bugfix release once a fortnight. We are not considering the inclusion of new features or improvements. The priority now must be to obtain a stable and reliable plug-in, one that will allow us to take things up again in the future with greater security and peace of mind.</p>
