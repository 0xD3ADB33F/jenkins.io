Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We all know that keeping important files in version control is critical, as it ensures problematic changes can be reverted and can serve as a backup mechanism as well. Code and resources are often kept in version control, but it can be easy to forget your continuous integration (CI) server itself! If a disk were to die or fall victim to a <a href="http://twitter.com/progrium/status/7646048501">misplaced</a> <code>rm -rf</code>, you could lose all the history and configuration associated with the jobs your CI server manages.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to create a repository, but it isn’t obvious which parts of your $HUDSON_HOME you’ll want to backup. You’ll also want to have some automation so new projects get added to the repository, and deleted ones get removed. Luckily we have a great tool to handle this: Hudson!</p>

<p>We have a Hudson job which runs nightly, performs the appropriate SVN commands, and checks in. The high-level overview of this job is basically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add any new jobs, users, plugin configurations, et cetera: <code>svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*</code></li>
  <li>Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists (such as a deleted job): <code>svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm</code></li>
  <li>Check it in! <code>svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration"</code>
You’ll want to make sure to use the <code>--non-interactive</code> option for any automated svn operations, as this ensures Subversion won’t hang asking a question but instead fail immediately. You may also need to provide your password with the <code>--password</code> option.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make such a Hudson job, create a new job, tie it to the master (since this is where the configuration files are), set it to build periodically (we use “@midnight”), and add an “Execute shell” build step. Here’s the full script we use, to put into the build step:</p>

<p><code type="bash">
# Change into your HUDSON_HOME.
cd /opt/hudson
# Add any new conf files, jobs, users, and content.
svn add -q --parents *.xml jobs/*/config.xml users/*/config.xml userContent/*
# Ignore things in the root we don't care about.
echo -e "warnlogn*.logn*.tmpn*.oldn*.bakn*.jarn*.json" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores . &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Ignore things in jobs/* we don't care about.
echo -e "buildsnlast*nnext*n*.txtn*.lognworkspace*ncoberturanjavadocnhtmlreportsnncoverndoclinks" &gt; myignores
svn propset svn:ignore -F myignores jobs/* &amp;&amp; rm myignores
# Remove anything from SVN that no longer exists in Hudson.
svn status | grep '!' | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs -r svn rm
# And finally, check in of course, showing status before and after for logging.
svn st &amp;&amp; svn ci --non-interactive --username=mrhudson -m "automated commit of Hudson configuration" &amp;&amp; svn st
</code></p>

<p>You’ll notice this does some extra things like set the svn:ignores property to provide a relatively clean <code>svn st</code> which it shows before and after the commit for logging purposes. One thing this job <em>doesn’t</em> do is put the build results of your jobs in version control. Because historical build logs and artifacts will never change and are also potentially large, a periodic (daily or weekly) <code>cp</code> or <code>rsync</code> of the <strong>jobs</strong> directory will still give you restorability while keeping your repository lean.</p>

<p>Now you can sleep well at night knowing that your CI server is safe and sound. If you are doing a similar thing with Hudson or another CI system, let us know about your solution!</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/02/09/whats-going-on-with-the-hudsons-infrastructure/'>
What's going on with the Hudson's infrastructure
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>A lot has changed in the Hudson development and distribution infrastructure since last summer - we've made a distinct effort to get the quality of our infrastructure to match the quality of Hudson itself. We owe a special thanks to the wonderful folks over at <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> - we're taking advantage of their generous <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/opensource/">open source license</a> for our bug tracking (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a>), wiki (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence<a>), and source repository browser (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/">FishEye</a>). Obviously, there's a lot more we can improve going forward - I'll have another post up soon, looking at some of the ideas we're kicking around. But for now, take a look at what we've already done, below the fold.
<!--break--></a></a></p>
<li>The Hudson war and plugin downloads have all moved off of the unreliable java.net to our own [hudson-ci.org](http://hudson-ci.org) with the downloads being powered by the same system used for distributing Java, OpenSolaris, and NetBeans. Downloading Hudson and/or plugins is now easier and more reliable.</li>
<li>We've moved issue tracking from java.net's system to our own JIRA instance, at [issues.hudson-ci.org](http://issues.hudson-ci.org). As with moving downloads off java.net, we've made reporting and browsing Hudson's issues much faster, easier and more reliable, while still using the same authentication on the back-end as our Subversion and Maven repositories. We're still working out some kinks in the system but since we're running our own issue tracker now, rather than using one we didn't have control over, we've got the flexibility we need to adapt our tools to best serve the developer and user communities.</li>
<li>Speaking of tools we now run ourselves, we've put up our own FishEye instance at [fisheye.hudson-ci.org](http://fisheye.hudson-ci.org) - until that was in place, we'd been relying on Atlassian's public FishEye instance, which has many other open source projects' repositories available. Getting our own server up means we don't have to bug the generous folks over at Atlassian every time the java.net SVN server confuses FishEye into failing to update. It also opens the door for us to use <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/">Crucible</a> for code review in the future.</li>
<li>Hudson's moved onto Twitter more and more over the last 6-9 months - we've got the always fabulous <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a>, tweeting new releases, Hudson-related tweets, and more, as well as the <a class="apturenoenhance" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23hudsonci">#hudsonci</a> hashtag.
<li>This may not strictly be infrastructure but it's worth mentioning that we've now got native packages and distribution for Hudson for <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/debian/">Ubuntu/Debian</a>, <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/redhat/">Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS</a>, <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/opensuse/">openSUSE</a>, <a href="http://pkg.hudson-ci.org/">OpenSolaris/Nevada</a>, and <a href="http://www.freshports.org/www/hudson/">FreeBSD</a>.</li>
<li>This is all in addition to key parts of our infrastructure that haven't changed: our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Home">official wiki</a>, our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">user and developer mailing lists</a>, our <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/">Subversion repository</a> (and a <a href="http://github.com/kohsuke/hudson/">Git mirror</a> on GitHub) and our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">IRC channel over on Freenode</a>.</li>

Oh, and I hear there's a blog now too.

**Editor's Note:** Andrew Bayer (`abayer`) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson's core and a small number of other plugins. Andrew also helps Kohsuke with a lot of Hudson's project infrastructure, most notably the migration from Bugzilla on Java.net to JIRA running at [issues.hudson-ci.org](http://issues.hudson-ci.org).

Breaking! Hudson 1.345 Released!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As I mentioned in the footer of the post on the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-1344-released">Hudson 1.344 release</a>, there were a couple big regressions in the 1.344 release that were causing a number of users issues (such as <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5536">issue 5536</a> and <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5546">issue 5546</a>).</p>

<p>As a result, Kohsuke and the team have quickly pushed out a hot-fix release: 1.345. Here's the break down:</p>

<h4 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;</p>
<li class="major bug">
    Update center retrieval, "build now" link, and real-time console update was broken in 1.344.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5536">issue 5536</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Fixed the backward incompatibility introduced in HUDSON-5391 fix in 1.344.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5391">issue 5391</a>)




If you have already updated to 1.344, your "Update Center" is most likely busted and you'll need to download the `hudson.war` file manually.


You can go grab the [latest .war file](http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war) straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.

Hudson 1.344 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>The latest release of Hudson, 1.344, was released on February 5th, 2010. The release contains primarily bug-fixes but has a few enhancements baked into it as well. As mentioned in "<a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/incoming-more-translations">Incoming! More Translations</a>", 1.344 incorporates a number of community-driven translations (see the other post for more information). Additionally, 1.344 removes the "easter egg" background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/2010/01/mourning_sun">Mourning Sun</a>.</p>

<p>Enough of the small talk, here's the breakdown.</p>

<h4 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed</h4>
<p>&lt;ul class=image&gt;
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Removed the forced upper casing in parameterized builds.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5391">issue 5391</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Password parameter on the disk should be encrypted.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5420">issue 5420</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Duplicate entries on Upstream/Downstream project with "Build modules in parallel".
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5293">issue 5293</a>)
  &lt;li class=bug&gt;</p>

<pre><code>"Projects tied on" should be "Projects tied to".
(&lt;a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5451"&gt;issue 5451&lt;/a&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;li class=bug&gt;
    Fixed the bug that prevents update center metadata retrieval in Jetty.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5210">issue 5210</a>)
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Enhancements</p>
<ul>
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Show which plugins have already been upgraded in Plugin Manager.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2313">issue 2313</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;
    Show Hudson upgrade status on manage page instead of offering same upgrade again.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-3055">issue 3055</a>)
  &lt;li class=rfe&gt;

    Make badges in build history line up.
    (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Align-lock-sign-of-keep-build-forever-td1016427.html">report</a>)
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Contributors 
This release of Hudson contained 44 commits from 5 different contributors to "core":</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This post was written a day before <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5536">issue 5536</a> was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.

Welcome to Continuous Blog!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Hello and welcome to "Continuous Blog", the official Hudson weblog! If you don't mind me saying so, I think its arrival is long overdue. Since Hudson started in November of 2006, there hasn't been a central "voice" for the project. In just a few short years Hudson has grown into a substantial project with <strong>hundreds</strong> of plugins and thousands of users around the world. <a id="aptureLink_DLc9nSxCmm" href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>'s nice Java-based extensible continuous integration server has grown up into fantastic tool with a great community around it.</p>

<h3 id="goals-for-this-weblog">Goals for this weblog</h3>
<p>I think it is important to set out a couple of goals for this weblog, some simple items that should help guide the content and discussion around Continuous Blog and its future.</p>

<p>Continuous Blog should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community</li>
  <li>Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels</li>
  <li>Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts</li>
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
### What to expect
As Continuous Blog grows and matures, you can expect to see a variety of Hudson-related content. Overviews of the latest releases of Hudson and its plugins, interviews and discussions with the developers who have contributed to Hudson over the years, guest posts by power-users on how Hudson fits into their workflow and much much more (really).</p>

<p>If you look around the page you'll already see a good amount of content, in the sidebar to the right you'll notice the "Recently Released" section which aggregates recently released plugins via <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectRSS?type=news">this RSS feed</a> , the "Blogs" section which is an aggregation of Hudson community blogs (from <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/KohsukesHudsonBlogs">this RSS feed</a>) and <a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci/lists/contributors" class="apturenoenhance">this Twitter list</a> of Hudson contributors.</p>

<p>We're just starting out so make sure you <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ContinuousBlog">subscribe to the RSS feed</a>, we've got a lot to talk about here on Continuous Blog.
