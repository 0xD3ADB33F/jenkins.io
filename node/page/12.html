Jenkins figure is available in shapeways 
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Some time ago, we've built <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/behind-scenes-jenkins-user-conference-palo-alto">Jenkins bobble head figures</a>. This was such a huge hit that everywhere I go, I get asked about them. The only problem was that it cannot be individually ordered, and we didn't have enough cycles to individually sell and ship them for those who wanted them.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So I decided to have the 3D model of Mr.Jenkins built, which would allow anyone to print them via 3D printer. I comissioned  <a href="https://www.fast-d.com/search/engineers/2798">akiki</a>, a 3D model designer, to turn our beloved butler into a fully-digital color-printable figure. He was even kind enough to discount the price with the understanding that this is for an open-source project.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The result was IMHO excellent, and when I finally came back to my house yesterday from a two-weeks trip, I found it delivered to my house:<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>
<img src="https://images1.sw-cdn.net/model/picture/625x465_2183445_3844009_1406574114.jpg" width=312 height=232><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
With the red bow tie, a napkin, a blue suit, and his signature beard, it is instantly recognizable as Mr.Jenkins. He's mounted on top of a red base, and is quite stable. I think the Japanese sensibility of the designer is really showing! Note that <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/materials/full-color-sandstone">the material</a> has a rough surface and it is not very strong, but that's what you trade to get full color.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/2183445/mr-jenkins.html?modelId=2183445&materialId=26">I've put it up on Shapeways so that you can order it yourself</a>. The figure is about 2.5in/6cm tall. The price includes a bit of markup toward recovering the cost of the design. My goal is to sell 25 of them, which will roughly break it even. Any excess, if it ever happens, will be donated back to the project.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Likewise, once I hit that goal, I will make the original data publicly available under CC-BY-SA, so that other people can modify the data or even print it on their own 3D printers.<br/>

JUC Israel report
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
This year marks the 3rd annual Jenkins User Conference in Israel. While the timing of the event turned out to be less than ideal for reasons beyond our control, that didn't stop 400 Jenkins users from showing up at the "explosive" event at a seaside hotel near Tel Aviv.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/shlomibenhaim">Shlomi Ben-Haim</a> kicked off the conference by reporting that JUC Israel just keeps getting bigger, and that we sold out 2 weeks earlier and the team had to turn down people who really wanted to come in. The degree of adoption of Jenkins is amazing in this part of the world, and we might have to find a bigger venue next year to accomodate everyone who wants to come.<br/>
<br/>
<div align=center><br/>

</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
It turns out most of the talks were in Hebrew, so it was difficult for me to really understand what's going on, but the talks ranged from highly technical ones like how to provision Jenkins from configuration management (the server as welll as jobs), all the way to more culture focused one like how to deploy CD practice in an organization. Companies large and small were well represented, and I met with a number of folks who actively contribute to the community.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
There were a lot of hall way conversations, and those of us at the booth had busy time.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Thanks everyone who came, thanks JFrog for being on the ground for the event (and congratulations for the new round of funding) and CloudBees for hosting the event. Please let us know if there are things we can do better, and see you again next year!<br/>

One of the challenges of running Jenkins User Conferences is to ballance the interest of attendees and the interest of sponsors. Sponsors would like to know more about attendees, but attendees are often weary of getting contacted. Our past few JUCs have been run by making it opt-in to have the contact information passed to sponsors, but the ratio of people who opt-in is too low. So we started thinking about adjusting this.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So our current plan is to reduce the amount of data we collect and pass on, but to make this automatic for every attendee. Specifically, we'd limit the data only to name, company, e-mail, and city/state/country you are from. But no phone number, no street address, etc. We discussed this in <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2014/jenkins.2014-07-09-18.02.html">the last project meeting</a>, and people generally seem to think this is reasonable. That said, this is a sensitive issue, so we wanted more people to be aware.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
By the way, <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb">the call for papers to JUC Bay Area</a> is about to close in a few days. If you are interested in giving a talk (and that's often the best way to get feedback and take credit on your work), please make sure to submit it this week.<br/>

The other day I was explaining how to implement a new workflow primitive to <a href="https://github.com/vivek">Vivek Pandey</a>, and I captured it as a recording.<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GsjIMPf1HPU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The recording goes over how to implement the <tt>Step</tt> extension point, which is the workflow equivalent of <tt>BuildStep</tt> extension point. If you are interested in jumping on the workflow plugin hacking, this might be useful (and don't forget to get in touch with us so that we can help you!)<br/>

After a very successful <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/juc-boston-what-day">JUC Boston</a> we headed over to Berlin for JUC Berlin. I've heard the attendance number was comparable to that of JUC Boston, with close to 400 people registered and 350+ people who came.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The event kicked off at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/189413622/">a pre-conference beer garden meetup</a>, except it turned out that the venue was closed on that day and we had to make an emergency switch to another nearby place, and missed some people during that fiasco. My apologies for that.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
But the level of the talks during the day more than made up for my failing. They covered everything from large user use cases from BMW to Android builds, continuous delivery to Docker, then of course workflow!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the key attractions of events like this is actually meeting people you interact with. There are <a href="https://twitter.com/fr3dg">all</a> the <a href="https://github.com/kutzi">usual</a> <a href="https://github.com/orrc">suspects</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/vlatombe">community</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">some who I've met for the first time</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions">Most of the slides are up</a>, and I believe the video recordings will be uploaded shortly, if you missed the event.
