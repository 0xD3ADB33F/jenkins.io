Tomorrow in Jenkins office hours, Surya Gaddipati will be going over <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/dotci">DotCi</a>, a package of features that integrates Jenkins closely with GitHub, configuration via .ci.yml file in source tree, built-in Docker support and MongoDB backend. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I think there's a number of interesting pieces here that could be split into individual plugins for reuse, and possible alignment with existing efforts like <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin">Script Security plugin</a> or <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin">Literate plugin</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To record the show, <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cmatf87mb6cfo090e063l10709g">this event will be in a different hangout from the usual one</a>, but <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140702T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1">the time is the same</a>.

We kicked off this year's Jenkins User Conference world tour in Boston this Wednesday. The event was well-attended with more than 450 people registered and 400+ people showed up. So big thank you for everyone who came!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin">Workflow plugin</a> that Jesse presented was a big hit and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jenkinsconf&src=typd">lit up twittersphere</a>, and while I was only able to listen to parts of sessions as people had questions and comments for me, ones that I've seen were great. <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-user-conference-completely-full">Alyssa</a> told me that the sponsors were happy too, which is also important to keep events like this going.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Perhaps the biggest hit of all was <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/get-drunk-code-juc-boston">the "get drunk on the code show</a> by Steven Christou. When I got in, he packed 30 or so people in the room learning how to write a simple Jenkins plugin, and all the beer bottles were long gone!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the "fun" activities we did during the event was a trivia quiz. I'm happy to announce the winners here &mdash; Tamara from IBM and Prabhu from Staples. Congrats for your Amazon gift cards!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
During the show, I've heard from several people that they'd love to see more regular local meet-ups. <a href="https://twitter.com/duncanmak">Duncan</a> had shown interest in organizing, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tyvole">Jesse</a> is a Bostonian, so please encourage them to get one going<br/>

I am very much looking forward to the Jenkins User Conference in Berlin next week which I will be attending with a three other members of my team.  We are all very passionate about automation, infrastructure-as-code, configuration management and of course… Jenkins.<br/>
 <br/>
My team and I specialize in implementing continuous delivery for large scale transformation deliveries. We work with a wide range of technologies from open source, packaged products, through to software-as-a-service.  We work with physical infrastructure, private cloud, public cloud and platforms-as-a-service, but there is one almost uniquely common factor… using Jenkins.<br/>
 <br/>
At the conference I will be expecting to exchange views with others using Jenkins at similar scale and am particularly interested in <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JosefFuchshuber">sessions</a> covering using Jenkins with Docker and making Jenkins <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#HarpreetSingh">more resilient</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
I am also looking forward to presenting <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#MarkRendell">this lightening talk</a> where I will be demoing ways in which we’ve extended Jenkins to implement complex integrated pipelines for large-scale software implementations.  <a href="http://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/reducing-continuous-delivery-impedance-part-2-solution-complexity/">See here</a> for a sneak preview.

<i>We're getting excited about the Boston and Berlin JUC's in the next two weeks! Here's a preview of Forest Handford's upcoming JUC-US East Lightning Talk on June 18...</i><br/>
<br/>
When <a href="http://home.meditech.com/en/d/home/">MEDITECH</a> migrated to Subversion from a home-grown first generation version control system we needed a way to get the code compiled and sent to the running server. We selected Jenkins as our build server, with the hope of eventually using it for CI.<br/>
<br/>
A MEDITECH application consists of hundreds of source files. Each source file translates to an object code file that the interpreter executes. This is one of the last major projects I worked on prior to leaving MEDITECH to work at Carbonite. In my Lightning Talk, "A Build Eco-System for Loosely Compiled Code," I'll discuss the toughest challenges my team had in getting Jenkins to work as our build server and how we eventually overcame them.<br/>
<br/>
Staff from both <a href="http://www.carbonite.com">Carbonite</a> and MEDITECH will be in attendance. Both companies are hiring!<br/>
<br/>
<i>You'll find more great talks in the full <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">JUC-US East</a> agenda and the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">JUC-Europe</a> agenda. </i>

Two Weeks Till Jenkins User Conference Berlin
</a>

<div class='content'>
Following right on the heels of our <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston">US-East Jenkins User Conference in Boston</a>, we have JUC Europe in Berlin on June 25. Like the East Coast conference, the Berlin one is almost full, so <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-europe-berlin-june-25-2014-tickets-10557974185">sign up while you can.</a><br/>
<br/>
Our venue in Berlin is <a href="http://www.kosmos-berlin.de/en/home.html">KOSMOS</a>, a building with <a href="http://www.kosmos-berlin.de/en/history.html">a fascinating history</a>. The building was inaugurated as a cinema in 1961. With 1001 seats, it was the largest, most modern and most popular film theatre in the former GDR and has since been extensively modernized in line with the requirements of historically listed buildings. <br/>
<br/>
We have <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">an excellent line-up of speakers</a> filling up two conference tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, we have some fabulous sponsors to thank. Without them, there would be no JUC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/JUC-Berlin-Sponsors.png" /> <br/>
<br/>
This year we’ve introduced a new Community sponsorship level, which allows non-corporate groups like JUGSs to help support the conference as well. (Drop a note to juc-oc-ext AT cloudbees DOT com if your group is interested).<br/>
<br/>
We are very grateful to all of our sponsors – thank you! Hopefully see everyone at JUC.<br/>
<br/>
PS – if you are coming to Berlin for JUC, check out the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/berlin">CD Summit on June 24</a> at the same venue. There’s also <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/nyc">one on June 19 in NYC</a>. The summit will focus on how continuous integration with Jenkins streamlines processes and automates testing and deployment, providing the foundation you need for continuous delivery.

One of the current efforts under way in the dev list is driven by <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a> et al, who is working on introducing a series of small ball improvements to the user interface in Jenkins. If this is something you are interested in (and who aren't?), you should see <a href="https://gist.github.com/kevinburke/9d4f127a7005eaa9d970">Kevin Burke's manifest</a> that sets out the plan of attack, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/zDaX4yiWLLw">This mega thread on the dev list</a> for the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
There are numerous sub-conversations born out of this, and one of them is the minimum required servlet spec version for Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Jenkins devs are thinking about ways to update page contents post load, for example so that the list view will keep updating as stuff happens. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websocket">WebSocket</a> was discussed as an option, and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">server-side events</a>, which seems to be the current favorite.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To use any of those async HTTP features, we need servlet 3.0. Unfortunately, if we are to do it, Jenkins will not run on earlier versions of the container. There's no graceful fallback that works with servlet 2.5 containers due to the way servlet 3.0 is written.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So I looked into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14YzFgKBB6BvbRU_1OjChC3efECWPs77TEGTU09t3KGw/edit#gid=873989456">the impact of this change to the users</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that the most users run Jenkins through <tt>java -jar jenkins.war</tt>, which are already running servlet 3.0 compatible Winstone 2.x (based on Jetty 8.) And people running newer version of Jenkins tends to run newer version of containers. When I look at people who are running >=1.509 and later, 70% of them run on servlet 3 compatible container. The number for >=1.532 is 84%, then for >=1.554 it's 94%.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When I look at which container is dragging us down as of >= 1.554, you see that there's a sizable Tomcat6 deployments (2.5%). If we start requiring Servlet 3.0 these people will be in a nasty surprise. Then there's about 1.8% who claims to be running on Winstone 0.9.10, which is really puzzling, but I'm assuming these people are getting OEM-ed Jenkins of a sort (multiple large companies are known to do this), so these people will likely be able to update to Winstone 2.x automatically by virtue of getting a new jenkins.war from their upstream. So all in all I'd say if we start requiring servlet 3.0 today, there'll be about 3% user base who will be impacted.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This post is a trial balloon to see the community reaction to this idea. If you have reasons to argue against us moving to servlet 3.0, we'd like to hear from you &mdash; <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23378">please share your thoughts on our issue tracker</a>!<br/>

If you will be on the US East Coast or in Berlin for JUC, some of the JUC sponsors are organizing separate events called <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit">Continuous Delivery Seminar</a>, which might be of interest to you. These events focus more on higher-level business value questions as well as vendor solutions that are difficult in community-focused JUC.<br/>
<br/>
