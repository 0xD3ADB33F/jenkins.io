Breaking! Hudson 1.351 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Rush delivery from Hudson HQ! Hudson 1.351 just rolled out with a <strong>very</strong> important regression fix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regression in 1.350 that can delete old build artifacts. (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Warning-about-Hudson-1-350-Could-delete-your-artifacts-td1593483.html">mailing list thread</a>, <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5937">issue 5937</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for the hiccup everybody, we're working pretty hard on getting a better, more stable, release process in place.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can go grab the <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/latest/hudson.war">latest .war file</a> straight from <code>hudson-ci.org</code> or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.</p>

Hudson 1.350 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Finishing off the second week in March, the Hudson team rolled Hudson 1.350 off the assembly line last Friday, bringing a <strong>slew</strong> of fixes. Of particular interest to users of Hudson's various native packages for <a id="aptureLink_TA4o7Z9zPa" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/red-hat">Red Hat</a>, <a id="aptureLink_Oxp1Nm6ywp" href="http://www.opensuse.org/">openSuSE</a>, <a id="aptureLink_60jXN9zINs" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu/Debian</a> and <a id="aptureLink_H9FnLHBvke" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29">Solaris</a>, was a change that suppress the "self-upgrade" functionality in the "Manage Hudson" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+CLI">Hudson CLI</a> (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-3796">issue 3796</a>) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.</p>

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/garbageman.jpg" align="right" />Internal to Hudson, some more changes from Alan Harder (a.k.a <a id="aptureLink_XwoYyUAc5v" href="http://blogs.sun.com/mindless">mindless</a>, a.k.a The Garbage Man), deprecating or otherwise removing deprecated APIs. Alan's been doing some great work on Hudson's internals, if you're coming out to <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co">this weekend's hackathon</a>, but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.

This Week in Plugins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Apologies for the slight delay in posting another <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/category/tags/plugins">TWiP</a>, both within the Hudson community and outside of it, it was quite a busy week. This past week we've had roughly <strong>15</strong> plugins released, with a few going through a number of iterations over the course of the week such as the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Emma+Plugin">Emma plugin</a> and one of Hudson's newest plugins, the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Libvirt+Slaves+Plugin">Libvirt Slaves plugin</a>.
<!--break-->
One of Hudson's most active contributors, Alan Harder (a.k.a <code>mindless</code>) was responsible for this week's only new plugin: <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Copy+Artifact+Plugin">Copy Artifact Plugin</a>. The Copy Artifact plugin does exactly what you'd think it does, according to the short-and-sweet wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adds a build step to copy artifacts from another project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're a plugin developer in the Bay Area, this upcoming Friday and Saturday is the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co">Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup</a>; don't miss out!</p>

Want some Hudson stickers?
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2743/4425921960_a056d816f1_m.jpg" align="right" /> Rarely do I ever get mail, let alone mail I like, so I was quite excited when a shipment of stickers from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SunSantaClaraCampus">Hudson HQ</a> arrived yesterday.  I'm certain you're thinking to yourself "what does this guy need hundreds of Hudson stickers for?" Fact is, I don't! They're not for me, they're for you!</p>

<p><strong>I am willing to mail stickers vast distances to you</strong> (<em>with some conditions</em>)</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
#### Conferences
If you're presenting at a conference or otherwise would like some Hudson stickers to go around, email me with a rough estimate of how many you need. The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).</p>

<h4 id="user-groups">User Groups</h4>
<p>If you email me requesting some stickers for a user group, I'll need an estimate of how many folks attend meetings. Depending on supplies, I may send you a little more than requested to be shared.</p>

<h4 id="companies">Companies</h4>
<p>If your company wants some Hudson stickers, I'd be happy to oblige, and of course I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: <a id="aptureLink_R5zxZUYv2n" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional%20item">swag</a>) in return!</p>

<h4 id="people-who-like-stickers">People who like stickers</h4>
<p>If you're just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I'll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to <a id="aptureLink_S4ASBrm3CN" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr">Flickr</a> (tagged: "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/tags/hudsonstickers/">hudsonstickers</a>")</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
I will be stuffing envelopes in my free time, so there may be a slight delay. You can email me at <code>tyler</code> at <code>linux</code> dot <code>com</code> requesting stickers, I'll need:</p>

<pre><code>How many: (estimate)
What for: (conference|usergroup|company|iwantsomeokay)
Mailing Address:

<a href='/blog/2010/03/09/one-month-of-continuous-blog/'>
One month of Continuous Blog
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>It's been a little over a month since I pinged Kohsuke about an "official Hudson blog"; my role has been nothing more than writer and editor of a community resource, while I have invested a lot of time in Continuous Blog it is not "mine" so much as it is "ours." I feel I have a responsibility as the current maintainer of this resource to be as open as possible about what's going on with CB. When I sat down to write the inaugural post, <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/welcome-continuous-blog">Welcome to Continuous Blog</a>, I set forth a few goals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community</li>
    <li>Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels</li>
    <li>Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog's traffic, then I'll get to reviewing the goals.</p>

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/cb_visits.png" width="550" />
<em>Visitor trend via Google Analytics</em></p>

<p>Over the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from a number of different sources, the top sources being:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a> links posted to <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a></li>
  <li>Direct visits</li>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a></li>
  <li>Referrals from the "blog" link on <a href="http://hudson-ci.org">hudson-ci.org</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/domain/hudson-ci.org">reddit</a></li>
  <li>Links from the <a href="http://java.net">Java.net</a> community portal and associated weblogs</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS subscribers.</p>

<p>To put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173 different developers and the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> twitter account has about 1,100 followers.</p>

<p><br clear="all" />
### Hudson Advocacy
Looking at the traffic sources and the volume of traffic coming from what I would consider "the wider internet community" I'd say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic seems to be coming from "within the community", which is certainly not a bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links to Continuous Blog and the content isn't "interesting" enough to come up in searches for terms like "continuous integration with python".</p>

<p>The vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney's post on <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/keeping-your-configuration-and-data-subversion">Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion</a> was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the past month. I'll be reaching out to more power-users from differing backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python, Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2 pros about guides.</p>

<h3 id="central-information-repository">Central information repository</h3>
<p>I feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we've been able to aggregate is small, but growing.</p>

<p>I have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases, but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time doing.</p>

<h3 id="recognition-of-contributors">Recognition of contributors</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this goal I've met. When writing up each Hudson release I've made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that contributed, Through the "spotlight" series of posts I've also made an effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately I've done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin developers, something I'm still not certain how to correct.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you've been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:</p>

      <li>This post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an informative listing of "what's happening" in plugin development for the past week.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Spotlight On"
    <ul>
      <li>The only interview-formatted series I've got going right now, I've been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson in interesting ways and are willing to let "us" peek behind the curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it's fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hudson 1.xxx Released
    <ul>
      <li>Pretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or editorializing on what's gone into the release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Links for
    <ul>
      <li>Roll-up of links shared or retweeted via the <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My two questions to the community in general would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you dislike any of these?</li>
  <li>What else would you like to see on a regular basis?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm certainly open to suggestion, I'd like Continuous Blog to continue to be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest challenge of Continuous Blog is <strong>time</strong>. As it stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">@hudsonci</a> and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn't maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=muni+hits+pedestrian">not uncommon around here</a>), this blog would go dark for a while.</p>

<p>This can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog, I'll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.</p>

<hr />

<p>All said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and following the Hudson community. I'm grateful for all those who've asked questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out for the <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co">meet-up in mid-March</a>, for the rest of you, I'll catch you on IRC :)</p>

Meet-up and Hack alongside Kohsuke and Co.
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Ever wanted to pick the brains of <strong>multiple</strong> Hudson developers and users, all at the same time? Feel like finally meeting Kohsuke in person? Now's your chance!</p>

<p>We're hosting our <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0">second-ever Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup</a> on <strong>March 19th and 20th</strong>. That's nearly <em>two</em> whole days of Hudson!</p>

<h3 id="day-one-mar-19">Day One (Mar. 19)</h3>
<p>The first day of the hackathon/meetup is aimed primarily at those working with Hudson's core, or are building on top of Hudson (plugins, etc).</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
  <li><em>End:</em>   5 p.m.</li>
  <li><em>Location:</em> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SunSantaClaraCampus">Oracle Santa Clara campus</a> in the "library" conference room of SCA7 "Mansion" building.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will a number of community and corporate Hudson hackers joining us on Friday, so bring everything you'll need to get some grade A hacking done with Kohsuke, Andrew Bayer, Alan Harder and your fellow plugin hackers.</p>

<h3 id="day-two-mar-20">Day Two (Mar. 20)</h3>
<p>I'm tentatively calling this the <strong>main event</strong>, which will be hosted at the delightful <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com">Hacker Dojo</a> in Mountain View. The "main event" will carry over the hackathon from the day before at Oracle, into a full blown community hackathon and meet-up. This is for Hudson <strong>hackers and users</strong> alike!</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
  <li><em>End:</em>   6 p.m.</li>
  <li><em>Location:</em> <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com/">Hacker Dojo</a> (Savanna room)</li>
</ul>

<p>As I've <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon">pointed out before</a>, Hudson's getting a lot of attention in other developer circles such as the Python, Ruby, Cocoa communities. As such, I'm hoping to get a lot of folks interested in using Hudson to come to Hacker Dojo where we (already being Hudson users) can help get them up to speed with all the great things Hudson can do.</p>

### How you can help
While I casually refer to myself as a "PR intern" for <a id="aptureLink_8uglegfosn" href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>, I'm technically a busy software engineer, meaning I'm grateful for all the help I can get.</p>

<h5 id="get-the-word-out">Get the word out</h5>
<p>The best way to help get the word out is to talk about Hudson and the meetup, this includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Link to this post on Twitter</li>
  <li>Ping any user groups you are a member of in the area</li>
  <li>Blog about it</li>
  <li>Let your co-workers know about it</li>
  <li>Attend!</li>
</ul>

<p><br clear="all" />
##### Volunteer to help setup/teardown
Hosting the Saturday event at Hacker Dojo does carry some responsibilities with it. We will need some extra hands to make sure everybody has power, refreshments are chilled, lunch is ordered and delivered, and of course, cleaning up after we leave. If you're in a generous mood, or in a real need for some karma, sign up to help on <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0">the bottom of the wiki page</a></p>

<p>I am hoping Oracle and some other heavy users/contributors will kick in a few bucks for lunch and drinks on Saturday, if you think your company can help us out, feel free to ping me directly at <code>tyler</code> at <code>linux.com</code>.</p>
