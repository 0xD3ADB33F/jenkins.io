#BreakingBuilds
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
A lot of us has grown fond of our loyal butler Mr.Jenkins over time, which was created by <a href="http://frontside.io/">Frontside</a> and chosen as <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/category/image-galleries/jenkins-logo-contest">a result of a logo contest</a>. In the true open-source style, the logo has since evolved into many different derivative works, such as <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Emotional+Jenkins+Plugin">a plugin</a>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-figure-available-shapeways">a 3D model</a>, and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/behind-scenes-jenkins-user-conference-palo-alto">a bobble head</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Our friends at CloudBees are running a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BreakingBuilds">#BreakingBuilds</a> social media contest through Jan 5th to have some fun with Mr.Jenkins. <a href="http://ow.ly/FbZDb">Read Sacha Labourey's blog post</a>, where he draws parallels between what a butler does and what continuous delivery can do.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I especially agree with him on this point:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><br/>
I always loved the idea of using a butler to represent what Jenkins is about, as it projects all of the qualities that define continuous delivery: it is built to be proactive, it will help you fix problems before they happen, it orchestrates your entire pipeline to production without you having to worry about the sophisticated underlying sequence of steps and, if things go wrong Jenkins uses his fingerprint database to trace back the source of the issue. Full service. As your right arm, Jenkins is the reliable and trustworthy guy you want on your team!<br/>
</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
<a href="http://ow.ly/FdEBD">Check out the contest rules</a> and participate. Let's raise the visibility of Jenkins and have some fun in the process!<br/>

<a href='/blog/2014/12/03/workflow-plugin-is-1-0/'>
Workflow plugin is 1.0
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Jenkins started with a notion of jobs and builds at heart. One script is one job, and as you repeatedly execute jobs, it creates builds as records. As the use case of Jenkins gets more sophisticated, people started combining jobs to orchestrate ever more complex activities.</p>

<p>A number of plugins have been developed to enable all sorts of different ways to compose jobs, and many are used quite successfully in production. But this resulted in a certain degree of complexity for users to figure out how to assemble these plugins.</p>

<p>So we felt the need to develop a single unified solution that subsumes all these different ways to orchestrate activities that may span across multiple build slaves, code repositories, etc. Various inputs from users as well as other plugin developers played a key role.</p>

<p>The result of this is <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin">the workflow plugin</a>, which is what a number of us, including Jesse Glick an myself, are focused on in the past few months.</p>

<p>The plugin approaches the problem by defining a DSL for you to describe an execution of a job. Various convenient primitives are available, such as executing shell scripts, checking out the source code, obtaining an executor or a build workspace, etc. All sorts of classic existing plugins contribute their functionalities into this DSL, such as recording test results, fingerprints, or calling into other existing jobs. This allows you to leverage higher-level functionalities and report comprehension capability into a workflow. Similarly, you can leverage the ability of Groovy, the host language of workflow DSL, to define control flows, abstractions, and reuse.</p>

<p>A key feature of a workflow execution is that it's suspendable. That is, while the workflow is running your script, you can shut down Jenkins or lose a connectivity to a slave. When it comes back, Jenkins will still remember what it was doing, and your workflow script resumes execution as if it was never interrupted. A technique known as the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation-passing style</a>" execution plays a key role in achieving this.</p>

<p>I'm very happy to report that the workflow plugin is finally 1.0. This version runs on the latest 1.580-based LTS. and <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/demo/README.md">we created a docker image for you to play with</a> too. There’s also <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/event/topic/workflow-jenkins-0">a JUC presentation</a> that explains this. We are working toward 1.0 release within this year, and in the meantime, the syntax is stable enough to allow you to start designing workflows today.</p>

<p>We've been hearing a lot of good feedbacks and enthusiasm for this new effort. Please let us know what you think.</p>

FreeBSD project use of Jenkins for OS testing
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>This is a guest post by Craig Rodrigues</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD project</a> produces a modern operating system derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD Unix</a>.</p>

<p>In the past 6 months, we have set up Jenkins at <a href="http://jenkins.freebsd.org/">http://jenkins.freebsd.org/</a>, to continuously build FreeBSD as developers add new code to the project. This has helped us identify and fix build breaks very quickly.</p>

<p>We have gone even farther by integrating Jenkins, <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/kyua#readme">Kyua</a>,
and <a href="http://bhyve.org/">Bhyve</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/jmmv/kyua#readme">Kyua</a> is a testing framework for infrastructure software.
<a href="http://bhyve.org/">Bhyve</a> is the native hypervisor that comes with FreeBSD (similar to KVM on Linux).</p>

<p>We use the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin">Build Flow plugin</a> in this <a href="https://jenkins.freebsd.org/jenkins/view/FreeBSD_src_stable/job/FreeBSD_stable_10/848/BuildGraph/">example Build flow</a>	 to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build the FreeBSD kernel and userland on amd64 whenever someone checks in new code to http://svn.freebsd.org</li>
  <li>Create a bootable FreeBSD disk image with <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=makefs">makefs</a></li>
  <li>Boot the image under bhyve</li>
  <li>Run these commands inside the bhyve VM:</li>
</ol>

<p><code>
    cd /usr/tests; kyua test; kyua report-junit --output=test-output.xml
</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Shut down the bhyve VM</li>
  <li>Imports test-output.xml into Jenkins.</li>
  <li>Produces a <a href="https://jenkins.freebsd.org/jenkins/job/FreeBSD_stable_10-tests/4/testReport/">full native test report in Jenkins</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The results of this work were presented at the <a href="http://bafug.org">Bay Area FreeBSD Users Group</a>
in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/CraigRodrigues1/kyua-jenkins">this presentation</a> in October 2014.</p>

<p>Jenkins has been very easy to set up and use under FreeBSD.   We hope that by using
Jenkins to run OS-level unit tests, we will be able to improve the quality of FreeBSD.

CVE-2014-3566 "poodle" impact on Jenkins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<div style="float:right; margin:1em"><br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Freddie_%288467901543%29.jpg/160px-Freddie_%288467901543%29.jpg"></a><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Another day, another SSL vulnerability! Google has <a href="https://poodle.io/">announced a vulnerability in SSL v3</a>, and if you are using the "Winstone" servlet container built into Jenkins, and if you are using the HTTPS connector with the <tt>--httpsPort</tt> option (it is off by default), then you are vulnerable to this problem.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I've just issued <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2014-10-15">a security advisory</a> on this. If you haven't already subscribed to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories">the Jenkins security advisory mailing list</a>, this is a great opportunity to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The advisory includes the target delivery vehicles for the fix and how you can address the problem in the mean time. Inside corporate intranet, where Jenkins is typically used, I suppose there's a degree of trust among participants to make this less of a problem. But if you run an internet facing Jenkins, be sure to deploy the fix.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
(And as I write this, I've fixed all the <tt>https://*.jenkins-ci.org</tt> servers to disable SSLv3, so we are covered there)
