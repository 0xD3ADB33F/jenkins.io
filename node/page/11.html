What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds

CVE-2014-6271 impact on Jenkins
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<div style="float:right; margin:1em"><br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Singapore"><br/>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg/240px-Singapore_Road_Signs_-_Restrictive_Sign_-_Stop_-_Security_Check.svg.png"><br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
I suspect many of you have been impacted by <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271">CVE-2014-6271</a> (aka "shellshock" bash vulnerability.) We had our share of updates to do for various *.jenkins-ci.org servers.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Java application servers in general (including one that ships in Jenkins) do not fork off processes like Apache does to serve requests, so the kind of CGI attacks you see on Apache does not apply. We are currently unaware of any vulnerabilities in Jenkins related to CVE-2014-6271, and no plan to issue a patch for that.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
That said, we did come up with one possible way attackers can exploit vulnerable bash through Jenkins, that you might want to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
When a build is parameterized, parameters are passed to the processes Jenkins launch as environment variables. So if you have a shell step (which uses <tt>bash</tt> by default), and if Eve only has a BUILD permission but not CONFIGURE permission, then Eve can exploit this vulnerability by carefully crafting parameter values, and have the bash runs arbitrary processes on the slave that run the build.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In most such scenarios, Eve would have to be an authenticated user on Jenkins. Jenkins also leaves the record of who triggered what build with what parameters, so there's an audit trail. But if your Jenkins fits this description, hopefully this serves as one more reason to update your bash.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>

The usual suspects, such as CloudBees, XebiaLabs, SOASTA, PuppetLabs, et al are <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/">doing a Jenkins-themed continuous delivery event series</a> called "cdSummit." The event is free, has a nice mix of user/vendor talks, and has an appeal to managers and team leads who are working on and struggling with continuous delivery and automation.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I've spoken in the past events, and I enjoyed the high-level pitches from various speakers.<br/>
The last two events at Paris and London filled up completely, so I suspect others have liked them, too.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you live near Chicago, Washington DC, or San Francisco, check out the date and see if you can make it. <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/">RSVP is from here</a>. If you do, be sure to pick up Jenkins stickers and pin badges!

There'll be several talks that touch Jenkins. The first is from me and Jesse called <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3387">Next Step in Automation: Elastic Build Environment [CON3387]</a> Monday 12:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Then later Tuesday, there's <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=11237">Building a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Gradle and Jenkins [CON11237]</a> from Benjamin Muschko of Gradleware.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Thursday has several Jenkins talks. One is <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1880">The Deploy Factory: Open Source Tools for Java Deployment [CON1880]</a> from Bruno Souza (aka the Java Man from Brazil) and Edson Yanaga. In this same time slot, guys from eBay are doing <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5685">Platform Upgrades as a Service [CON5685]</a>, which discusses how they rely on automation to make platform upgrades painless. Then <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1844">Mastering Continuous Delivery and DevOps [CON1844]</a> from Michael Huttermann.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
In <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/floor-plans/index.html">the exhibit area</a>, the Jenkins project doesn't have its own booth (JavaOne is too expensive for that), but I'll be at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/javaone-14-hilton-exhibits-2023244.pdf">the CloudBees booth</a>, so is Jesse Glick. Find us at the booth for any Jenkins questions or impromptu hacking session, which would really help us as we get distracted from the booth duties that way. Or just drop by to get stickers, pin badges, and other handouts to take for your colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And finally, <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2939">Script Bowl 2014: The Battle Rages On [CON2939]</a> gets an honorable mention because <a href="https://twitter.com/agentdero">our own Tyler Croy</a> is representing JRuby against other scripting languages, including my favorite Groovy. Hmm, who should I root for...

<a href='/blog/2014/08/12/official-jenkins-lts-docker-image/'>
Official Jenkins LTS docker image
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
(This is a guest post from <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelneale">Michael Neale</a>)<br/>
<hr><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Recently at the Docker Conference (DockerCon) the <a href="http://hub.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> was announced.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The hub (which includes their image building and storage service) also provides some &quot;official&quot; <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">images</a> (sometimes they call them repositories - they are really just sets of images).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So after talking with all sorts of people we decided to create an official <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/" target="_blank">Jenkins image</a> - which is hosted by the docker hub simply as &quot;jenkins&quot;.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>So when you run &quot;docker pull jenkins&quot; - it will be grabbing this image. This is based on the current LTS (and will be kept up to date with the LTS) - but does not include the weekly releases (yet). Having a jenkins image that is fairly basic (it includes enough to run some basic builds, as well as jenkins itself) built on the LTS, on the latest LTS of Ubuntu seemed quite convenient - and easy to maintain using the official Ubuntu/Debian packaging of Jenkins. <br/>
</p><br/>
<p><br/>
Docker is a great way to try and use server based systems - it brings all the dependencies needed and the images actually are portable (ie anywhere docker runs you can run docker images). There are official images for many popular server platforms (redis, mysql, all the linux distros and so on) so it seemed crazy to not include Jenkins along with this list. <br/>
&quot;docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins&quot; is all you need to get going with LTS Jenkins now.<br/>
You can also use &quot;docker run jenkins:1.554&quot; to get the latest of that lineage of LTS releases, or pick a specific one: &quot;docker run jenkins:1.554.3&quot; if you like. Leaving off a version assumes the latest. Check the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/tags/manage/" target="_blank">tags</a> page to see what is available.<br/>
</p><br/>
<br/>
<p> <br/>
You can read more and see how you <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/" target="_blank">can use it here.</a><br/>
</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
There has been some questions and discussions on how to make use of Jenkins with the docker hub for creating new and interesting docker image based workflows for deployment. <br/>
In fact, Jenkins featured in one of the first slides of the first keynote of docker con:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qAC-f6ceVho/U5rfqpzj3VI/AAAAAAAAC8w/Ta4pzEhm-8A/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-06-13+at+8.34.10+pm.png"><br/>
<br/>
To make this dream a reality some additional <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DockerHub+Plugin" target="_blank">plugins</a> had to be created - but this leaves the possibility of working with the docker hub (builds, stores images) and Jenkins (workflow, testing, deployment) to build out some kind of a continuous pipeline for handling docker based apps. I attempted to describe this more <a href="http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2014/07/announcing-dockerhub-jenkins-plugin.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
</p><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This image is maintained in this github <a href="https://github.com/cloudbees/jenkins-ci.org-docker" target="_blank">repo</a> and the official images are build by the <a href="https://github.com/docker/stackbrew" target="_blank">&quot;stackbrew&quot; system</a>. (We may move this repo to the jenkinsci github group shortly so keep an eye out).<br/>
</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>It will be interesting to watch this grow and change.</p><br/>
