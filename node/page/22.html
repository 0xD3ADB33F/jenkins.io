We are trying to <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160">raise $2000 travel grants</a> for assisting Jenkins contributors to travel, meet, and strengthen their relationships with the other Jenkins contributors. Specifically, we have <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/">SCALE11x</a> in mind, in which there already are a fair amount of Jenkins contributors concentration.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Being an open-source project, Jenkins developers are highly dispersed, yet a lot gets done in the community through human relationships, just like any other organizations. This poses a challenge, because most of the contributors work on Jenkins on their spare times, and so people are on their own to travel to the shows, creating greater divides between those of us in the U.S., Europe, and in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This fundraising is a bit of experiment to see if it's worth the money. The goal is to sponsor two people who don't work on Jenkins full time to travel to those events (and hopefully present talks, although that's subject to the acceptance by conferences.) We'll also report back what came out of them.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you think this is a worthy goal, <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160">please consider donating</a>. If you'd like to donate but not for this cause, please drop us a note so that we can attribute it accordingly.

<p>(This is a guest post by Tony França)</p>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/images/FS_vertical_logo_colored_512x347.png" width="128" height="87" />
</div>

<p>Hi all, my name is Tony, I'm the creator of (<a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/">FreedomSponsors</a>) and today I want to talk how Jenkins has inspired me to build it.</p>

<p>Before starting, I'd like to thank the Jenkins crew for letting me publish this guest post in their blog.
On top of that, thank you for maintaining Jenkins as well - I'm a big fan and a heavy user. Jenkins potential to make peoples lives easier is really amazing.
You guys are amazing.
And Kohsuke, you're my personal hero :-)</p>

<p>All right, that being said, let's move on with the story.</p>

<p>Most people who like FreedomSponsors probably don't know that Jenkins is sort of the reason it exists in the first place. That's right, if it wasn't for Jenkins I'd probably never had the idea for FS.</p>

<p>This is how it happened.</p>

<p>I was playing with the (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/OpenID+plugin">Jenkins OpenID plugin</a>), and I was having some trouble with it.
After a little research, I found that there was a JIRA bug for it - (<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9216">JENKINS-9216: Make OpenID work with Google Apps accounts</a>).</p>

<p>"Bummer" - I thought - "Maybe I can try to debug it. Oh boy, but I don't know anything about Jenkins code. That would be too… expensive! I bet there are a few people out there that would be willing to even pay a few bucks to the Jenkins crew to prioritize this."</p>

<p>The moment I thought that, a storm of ideas came rushing into my head.
It was like a conversation with myself in my mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Wait a minute… why can't people actually do just that?! They should be able to."</li>
  <li>"Maybe a JIRA plugin could let them…"</li>
  <li>"But what about other projects, ones that don't use JIRA?"</li>
  <li>"Maybe there could be a central place for all those offers. If many people 'sponsor' the same issue, the developer who solve it might get a decent piece of gold - rightfully deserved. That could even free up more of their time to work on the projects they love :-)"</li>
  <li>"The sponsors would pay the developers out of gratitude, and for the sake of keeping their word."</li>
  <li>"This has the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> spirit in it: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"</li>
</ul>

<p>And I kept thinking, and it didn't took very long until I had the whole "sponsoring model" in my head.
I realised that that was one of the best ideas I had in my life. I was very excited and I had to act on it.</p>

<p>I started studying <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> on that same day. I had already learned some Python before and Django had been on my queue for some time. And I'm glad I did it. I've been building JavaEE (Java web) applications for about 8 years now, and, oh boy, Django makes things soooo much easier, and simpler, and faster to code - I'm in love with it… Okay, but I'm missing the point here.</p>

<p>So, I started building "it" alone on my free time. It took me a few days to pick a name for "it".
The "FreedomSponsors" name came very naturally - it rightfully conveys what the platform would do, and the spirit of software freedom that I'd like to encourage.</p>

<p>Seven weeks later it was done. I had already bought the domain and created an account at Amazon AWS.
So I put it up and started bugging everyone about it.
And guess who was the first person I wanted to tell? Kohsuke Kawaguchi :-)
It was just fair. So I sent him this email.</p>

  <p>Hi Kohsuke.
My name is Tony, I'm a Software Architect.
I'm a big fan and a (very) heavy user of Hudson - Jenkins.
It has really been enabling our company to move towards a "continuous delivery"-like development process in the past couple of years.</p>

  <p>So, thank you for that.</p>

  <p>Also, if it wasn't for Jenkins, maybe I would never had the idea to build the FreedomSponsors web site.
That's my personal project - an idea that I had about six weeks ago.</p>

  <p>You see, most of the time I was developing it, I had you in mind.
I have always felt that "Jenkins is so great, that Kohsuke really deserves to get rich for it".</p>

  <p>I just launched FreedomSponsors - a few minutes ago.
It just felt right to come here and tell you about it :-)</p>

  <p>Let's see if I can get you rich now :-).</p>

  <p>Cheers!
Tony Lâmpada</p>

<p>And his reply just made my day</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 5:19 PM, Kohsuke Kawaguchi <kk at="" kohsuke="" dot="" org=""> wrote:</kk></p>

  <p>Congratulations for launching your service.</p>

  <p>I thought about a similar idea long time ago over a lunch with my colleagues, but my hats off to you for actually making it real. I can imagine a lot of obstacles (most of those you already note in FAQ), but if this works out I think it'd be great.</p>

  <p>By the way, I wonder if you have considered open-sourcing this, say under Aflo GPL. With the network effect and being the dominant contributor, it's very difficult for anyone else to run the same code on public internet to compete with you, and it does let other people contribute small changes, and given your audience is open-source developers, I think it sends the right message as well as help you boost your development. It also seeds the ecosystem (of Bugzilla plugin, JIRA plugin, dashboard, etc.), too.</p>

  <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, FS's code was still closed when I launched it. I was worried about competition indeed.
But his arguments were very convincing. Specially when he talked about sending the right message to the Free Software community. I thought about it for while and came to the conclusion that he has absolutely right. It still took me a few weeks until I moved <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org">the code to Github</a>. I'm glad I did it. The feedback loop has been great.</p>

<p>And that was not his only contribution. He also gave us this very useful piece of feeback:
(<a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/12/jira-plugin-to-link-from-tickets-to-freedomsponsors">JIRA plugin to link from tickets to FreedomSponsors</a>)</p>

<p>Indeed, that was a great idea. My friend and associate Arthur is the one who built it.
Kohsuke suggested that I joined the Jenkins crew at the (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">Jenkins Governance meeting</a>) to see if everyone would agree about installing it on Jenkins JIRA. Everyone liked the idea and had no ojections.</p>

<p>I can't say enough how trilled and honored I felt knowing that Jenkins would be the first project to install our plugin. Thank you folks. Thanks Kohsuke. You guys are awesome :-)</p>

<p>Now FreedomSponsors is growing, slowly but steadily. And what makes us really happy is that almost every developer we tell about it just loves the idea. We've received valuable, constructive feedback from a lot of people who want to see us moving forward. That's the best incentive that I could wish for.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. The biggest and closest one in the horizon is to start a "movement" that will help spread within companies a culture of contributing more to the free software projects they depend on, by making they realise that that's what's best for everyone. If we can achieve that then we'll have made the free software world even better.</p>

<p>So, everything I wrote so far is, hopefully, only the begginning of this story. And I'm really excited and looking forward to see it unfold. Being a part of it is even more exciting.</p>

This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142">discussed what we wanted to ask</a> among ourselves and revised some more.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on &mdash; in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Last year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM</a>, picked up several key UI improvements, and <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements">we've actually delivered on those</a>. This year I hope to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The survey will close at the end of October, and if you participate, you'll get to see the results first. As an added incentive, CloudBees had pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card. So <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/survey">please let your voice be heard</a>.

Jenkins sessions at JavaOne
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
It's the JavaOne season again in San Francisco. This year, there are whopping 6 sessions that discuss Jenkins (including myself, which is the very first session in Monday!) Unfortunately some of them happen in the same time, but I for one am looking forward to seeing the mobile app test talk from Intuit.<br/>
<br/>
<dl><br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6256">CON6256 - Large-Scale Automation with Jenkins</a> (Monday 8:30am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Jenkins is the most adopted open source continuous integration server today, and beyond the automated build and test, it is a platform for launching all kinds of automation tasks. As the use of Jenkins grows inside an organization, people are automating complex activities that need to be choreographed—such as deploying an application, running a load test, cleaning up the environment, and then handing over the build to the operation team. Such orchestration of activities is a very useful building block for continuous delivery, a practice promoted in recent years. This session looks at various patterns and plug-ins that deal with this kind of choreography. It also briefly discusses what’s new in recent versions of Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3648">CON3648 - Take Your Mobile Applications Tests to the Next Level: Continuous Integration</a> (Monday 1pm, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Mobile tests today can be automated by popular mobile testing frameworks in Java such as monkeyrunner, Sikuli, and Robotium. However, getting mobile tests running in continuous integration is not widely understood and rarely implemented. Whether you are an experienced mobile developer or tester or new to the mobile field, this session informs you about the complexities of emulators and devices and how you can navigate through each challenge to integrate mobile tests into Jenkins. You will be guided step-by-step through two case studies on how to integrate native Android and iPhone application tests by using monkeyrunner and Sikuli, respectively, into Jenkins. Leave with Java code samples of these automated tests as well as practical knowledge of mobile devices and emulators.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2822">CON2822 - Real-World Strategies for Continuous Delivery with Maven and Jenkins</a> (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Maven is close to ubiquitous in the world of enterprise Java, and the Maven dependency ecosystem is the de facto industry standard. However, the traditional Maven build and release strategy, based on snapshot versions and carefully planned releases, is difficult to reconcile with modern continuous delivery practices, where any commit that passes a series of quality-control gateways can qualify as a release. How can teams using the standard Maven release process still leverage the benefits of continuous delivery? This presentation discusses strategies that can be used to implement continuous delivery solutions with Maven and demonstrates one such strategy using Maven, Jenkins, and Git.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=12570">CON12570 - Pragmatic Continuous Delivery</a> (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
When you send a package via FedEx, it goes through a tracked, automated process that makes sure the package arrives promptly at the destination. Continuous delivery describes how this process can similarly be made fully automated and transparent, with your commits “fedexed” to production. The focus of continuous delivery is the delivery pipeline. Every commit that enters the pipeline should go through automated integration and testing, and if successful, produce a release candidate. This presentation is based on a demo that uses Jenkins to orchestrate the delivery pipeline; Nexus for long-running and manual workflows; and LiveRebel to make production updates quick, automated, nondisruptive, and reversible.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3363">CON3363 - HTML5 Testing in All Browsers with Java</a> (Tuesday 11:30am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
Would you love to test your HTML5 app in all browsers? The biggest challenge in writing HTML5 applications is that your application must run on many platforms, ranging from old desktop browsers to cutting-edge mobile browsers. Each browser behaves nearly the same, but inconsistencies can lead to major bugs. In this session, JavaOne Rockstar and Java Champion Kevin Nilson shows how you can leverage open source Java tools to test your HTML5 application in all browsers. The presentation shows examples of using tools such as TestSwarm, QUnit, jQuery, Jenkins/Hudson, Oracle VM VirtualBox, GlassFish Server technology, and Sun SPOTs to test your HTML5 application in all browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=12983">CON12983 - Java PaaS: The Engine for Delivering Enterprise and Mobile Applications</a> (Wednesday 8:30am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
Attend this demo-filled session that shows you how to use Java platform as a service (PaaS) to deploy complete enterprise applications in the cloud with Eclipse, Jenkins, and MySQL in addition to iOS/Android clients and full end-to-end continuous integration. In a few minutes, you’ll have cloud-based Git/SVN repositories set up with CI builds triggered automatically and your apps, databases, and supporting services up and running live. The presentation also shows how you can add more PaaS services—ALM, Web monitoring and analytics, hosted log management, e-mail integration, enterprise search, cloud DB services, and much more—to your apps right off the bat. Experience the future of Java development!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And it looks like the jclouds session will also touch jgroups plugin:<br/>
<br/>
<dl><br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=8009">CON8009 - What’s New in jclouds 1.5</a> (Monday 10am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
jclouds 1.5 is the result of 3.5 years of development by nearly 100 developers interested in portable cloud computing. During this session, you’ll get up-to-date with cloud computing technology developments such as OpenStack. You’ll learn how to use jclouds 1.5 to control private and public infrastructures and storage clouds programmatically. You’ll also see examples of new tools powered by jclouds, including Jenkins and Brooklyn.<br/>

<br/>
<p><br/>
Based on the experience from the last year, we are going to make a reservation for a dinner after JUC. If you are interested in joining us, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/">please RSVP</a>. We haven't decided where to go, but we'll place a reservation somewhere (and if you know a good place to go, please tell us, too!), so that we won't have to spend 30 minutes on the street looking for a place for a crowd.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Eating is more fun when there are more people. Please join us!

Jenkins project meeting in the meat space / Call for agenda
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">bi-weekly IRC meeting</a> where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project running.</p>

<p>Next Sunday, we'll bring this project meeting live to <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don't normally come to these meetings, I'd like to encourage everyone to propose agenda items and add it to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda#GovernanceMeetingAgenda-JenkinsUserConferenceMeeting@SanFrancisco">the agenda page</a>.</p>

<p>The Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what it is like. But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you'd like to get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on things, please don't hesitate to add them.</p>

<p>I still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over with IRC — I'd like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I'd like either real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live broadcasting of the room.</p>

... and be a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA agent</a> too! If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Just Do It!<br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Admittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find an organizer or two</b>. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists">Jenkins Dev email list</a> and on your Twitter account using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23JenkinsCI">#JenkinsCI</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Let the Jenkins project know</b>. <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">Let</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev/topics">us</a> <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat ">know</a> so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional slaves I mean helpers in your city. And if you're recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Decide how often you want to meet</b>. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Go to Meetup.com</b>. We have <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/">an account that we can let you use</a>, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Determine the topic for your first meetup</b>. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you'll have an automatic pool of interested parties.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Come up with a format for the meetup</b>. Here's an idea for a schedule: <br/>
6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies<br/>
6:30-6:35: Announcements<br/>
6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)<br/>
7:15-7:30: Q&A<br/>
7:30: Wrap up, chat<br/>
8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find a venue, preferably a free one</b>. Ideally, your company or one you know can         host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Ask a company or two to sponsor the meetup</b>, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they're hiring, and to support         the Jenkins community in general.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Plan the room logistics</b>. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It's a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Get the word out in any way you can</b>. Some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Tell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.<br/>
<li>If you use Meetup.com, they'll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they'll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.<br/>
<li>Email folks at         your company who might be interested<br/>
<li>Email friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word<br/>
<li>Post the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles<br/>
<li>If you know of         any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post         your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may                 receive.<br/>
</ol><br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
Additional tips:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Get someone to record the event. Doesn't have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if         you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.<br/>
<li>Plan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won't make it. It's a free event, and plans         tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.<br/>
<li>Remember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or         other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you're probably fine with beer, Coke and water.<br/>
<li>Bring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).<br/>
<li>Consider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even         their product or service).<br/>
<li>At the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to         cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).<br/>
<li>Vary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.<br/>
<li>Start and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.<br/>
<li>Join forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups!         For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.<br/>
