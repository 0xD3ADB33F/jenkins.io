Take the Jenkins Survey!

<p><br/>
Just like <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/12/jenkins-community-survey-results-82.html">the last year</a>, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/survey">we are running a survey this year</a>, to  get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">individual bug reports and feature requests</a> all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend. But we also <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2012/jenkins.2012-09-19-18.00.log.html#l-142">discussed what we wanted to ask</a> among ourselves and revised some more.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The tricky thing about being an open-source project is that it's not like some of us can actually decide what we'll be working on &mdash; in the end it's up to individual contributors to decide what they want to work on. So I can't make promises, but in a way, that's precisely why we'd like to get these objective, measurable, quantitative feedbacks. It lets us discuss how to solve the problem, instead of spending time discussing what the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Last year, we've heard loud and clear that people wanted to see some UI improvements. So a bunch of us sit down at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM</a>, picked up several key UI improvements, and <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/UI+Enhancements">we've actually delivered on those</a>. This year I hope to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The survey will close at the end of October, and if you participate, you'll get to see the results first. As an added incentive, CloudBees had pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card. So <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/survey">please let your voice be heard</a>.

Jenkins sessions at JavaOne
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
It's the JavaOne season again in San Francisco. This year, there are whopping 6 sessions that discuss Jenkins (including myself, which is the very first session in Monday!) Unfortunately some of them happen in the same time, but I for one am looking forward to seeing the mobile app test talk from Intuit.<br/>
<br/>
<dl><br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6256">CON6256 - Large-Scale Automation with Jenkins</a> (Monday 8:30am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Jenkins is the most adopted open source continuous integration server today, and beyond the automated build and test, it is a platform for launching all kinds of automation tasks. As the use of Jenkins grows inside an organization, people are automating complex activities that need to be choreographed—such as deploying an application, running a load test, cleaning up the environment, and then handing over the build to the operation team. Such orchestration of activities is a very useful building block for continuous delivery, a practice promoted in recent years. This session looks at various patterns and plug-ins that deal with this kind of choreography. It also briefly discusses what’s new in recent versions of Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3648">CON3648 - Take Your Mobile Applications Tests to the Next Level: Continuous Integration</a> (Monday 1pm, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Mobile tests today can be automated by popular mobile testing frameworks in Java such as monkeyrunner, Sikuli, and Robotium. However, getting mobile tests running in continuous integration is not widely understood and rarely implemented. Whether you are an experienced mobile developer or tester or new to the mobile field, this session informs you about the complexities of emulators and devices and how you can navigate through each challenge to integrate mobile tests into Jenkins. You will be guided step-by-step through two case studies on how to integrate native Android and iPhone application tests by using monkeyrunner and Sikuli, respectively, into Jenkins. Leave with Java code samples of these automated tests as well as practical knowledge of mobile devices and emulators.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2822">CON2822 - Real-World Strategies for Continuous Delivery with Maven and Jenkins</a> (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<br/>
<dd><br/>
Maven is close to ubiquitous in the world of enterprise Java, and the Maven dependency ecosystem is the de facto industry standard. However, the traditional Maven build and release strategy, based on snapshot versions and carefully planned releases, is difficult to reconcile with modern continuous delivery practices, where any commit that passes a series of quality-control gateways can qualify as a release. How can teams using the standard Maven release process still leverage the benefits of continuous delivery? This presentation discusses strategies that can be used to implement continuous delivery solutions with Maven and demonstrates one such strategy using Maven, Jenkins, and Git.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=12570">CON12570 - Pragmatic Continuous Delivery</a> (Tuesday 10am, Hilton)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
When you send a package via FedEx, it goes through a tracked, automated process that makes sure the package arrives promptly at the destination. Continuous delivery describes how this process can similarly be made fully automated and transparent, with your commits “fedexed” to production. The focus of continuous delivery is the delivery pipeline. Every commit that enters the pipeline should go through automated integration and testing, and if successful, produce a release candidate. This presentation is based on a demo that uses Jenkins to orchestrate the delivery pipeline; Nexus for long-running and manual workflows; and LiveRebel to make production updates quick, automated, nondisruptive, and reversible.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3363">CON3363 - HTML5 Testing in All Browsers with Java</a> (Tuesday 11:30am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
Would you love to test your HTML5 app in all browsers? The biggest challenge in writing HTML5 applications is that your application must run on many platforms, ranging from old desktop browsers to cutting-edge mobile browsers. Each browser behaves nearly the same, but inconsistencies can lead to major bugs. In this session, JavaOne Rockstar and Java Champion Kevin Nilson shows how you can leverage open source Java tools to test your HTML5 application in all browsers. The presentation shows examples of using tools such as TestSwarm, QUnit, jQuery, Jenkins/Hudson, Oracle VM VirtualBox, GlassFish Server technology, and Sun SPOTs to test your HTML5 application in all browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=12983">CON12983 - Java PaaS: The Engine for Delivering Enterprise and Mobile Applications</a> (Wednesday 8:30am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
Attend this demo-filled session that shows you how to use Java platform as a service (PaaS) to deploy complete enterprise applications in the cloud with Eclipse, Jenkins, and MySQL in addition to iOS/Android clients and full end-to-end continuous integration. In a few minutes, you’ll have cloud-based Git/SVN repositories set up with CI builds triggered automatically and your apps, databases, and supporting services up and running live. The presentation also shows how you can add more PaaS services—ALM, Web monitoring and analytics, hosted log management, e-mail integration, enterprise search, cloud DB services, and much more—to your apps right off the bat. Experience the future of Java development!<br/>

<br/>
<dt><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=8009">CON8009 - What’s New in jclouds 1.5</a> (Monday 10am, Parc 55)</dt><br/>
<dd><br/>
jclouds 1.5 is the result of 3.5 years of development by nearly 100 developers interested in portable cloud computing. During this session, you’ll get up-to-date with cloud computing technology developments such as OpenStack. You’ll learn how to use jclouds 1.5 to control private and public infrastructures and storage clouds programmatically. You’ll also see examples of new tools powered by jclouds, including Jenkins and Brooklyn.<br/>

Based on the experience from the last year, we are going to make a reservation for a dinner after JUC. If you are interested in joining us, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/">please RSVP</a>. We haven't decided where to go, but we'll place a reservation somewhere (and if you know a good place to go, please tell us, too!), so that we won't have to spend 30 minutes on the street looking for a place for a crowd.<br/>

Jenkins project meeting in the meat space / Call for agenda
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">bi-weekly IRC meeting</a> where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project running.</p>

<p>Next Sunday, we'll bring this project meeting live to <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don't normally come to these meetings, I'd like to encourage everyone to propose agenda items and add it to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda#GovernanceMeetingAgenda-JenkinsUserConferenceMeeting@SanFrancisco">the agenda page</a>.</p>

<p>The Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what it is like. But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you'd like to get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on things, please don't hesitate to add them.</p>

<p>I still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over with IRC — I'd like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I'd like either real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live broadcasting of the room.</p>

Start Your Own Jenkins Meetup in 10 Easy Steps

<p><br/>
... and be a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program">Jenkins CIA agent</a> too! If you're interested in building an active local Jenkins community, read on to learn how. Really, we can sum it up in one simple step:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Just Do It!<br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Admittedly more detailed guidelines can be useful, so hopefully these steps will give you a roadmap and some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find an organizer or two</b>. This is probably you. If you can draft a friend, colleague, or random acquaintance or three to help, even better. To enlist additional help in your area, put the word out on the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists">Jenkins Dev email list</a> and on your Twitter account using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23JenkinsCI">#JenkinsCI</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Let the Jenkins project know</b>. <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">Let</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev/topics">us</a> <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat ">know</a> so that we can help you. We can promote it on the JenkinsCI blog, promote that on Twitter, and post a summary blog. We can send stickers for you to hand out in the meetup, and we can send you a T-shirt for you to wear. We might be even able to find you additional slaves I mean helpers in your city. And if you're recording the event or streaming it live (we can tell you how), the whole Jenkins world may want to know!<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Decide how often you want to meet</b>. Once a month is a good frequency, but if you feel like all you can manage is every two months or even every quarter, go for it! You can always change it.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Go to Meetup.com</b>. We have <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/">an account that we can let you use</a>, or you can create your own meetup. They make it very easy to manage attendance and also to spread the word to people with similar interests in your community.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Determine the topic for your first meetup</b>. You could feature a speaker or two, or host a panel discussion, or just get folks together to talk about how you use Jenkins. YOU would probably be a great speaker for your first meetup – or perhaps some of your colleagues or friends. If you prefer to stay behind the scenes, Twitter and the Jenkins Dev list can help you find a speaker too. And as your meetup grows, you'll have an automatic pool of interested parties.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Come up with a format for the meetup</b>. Here's an idea for a schedule: <br/>
6-6:30pm: Check in, Networking & Munchies<br/>
6:30-6:35: Announcements<br/>
6:35-7:15: Speaker/panel (can also have 2 speakers, which might go longer)<br/>
7:15-7:30: Q&A<br/>
7:30: Wrap up, chat<br/>
8:00: Say goodnight, or go out together and keep drinking<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Find a venue, preferably a free one</b>. Ideally, your company or one you know can         host… then the venue is free. Alternate solutions: hotels (which unfortunately cost $$$) or reserve a room at a local bar or restaurant. Sometimes a university or even a library can help out with a free room.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Ask a company or two to sponsor the meetup</b>, which consists of paying for food and drinks for all (and some companies will bring along SWAG). Often the company hosting the venue will also sponsor. Sponsoring is a great way for companies to generate positive publicity in their locale, to get the word out that they're hiring, and to support         the Jenkins community in general.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Plan the room logistics</b>. Consider how you want the room to be set up – theater style or as individual tables to encourage group discussions. Also make arrangements to secure a projector and screen. It's a good idea to bring along connectors for both Mac and PC.<br/>
<br/>
<li><br/>
<b>Get the word out in any way you can</b>. Some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Tell us so that we can promote it through our existing channels.<br/>
<li>If you use Meetup.com, they'll help get the word out. And as more people join to attend one meetup, they'll receive word about future meetups too. EventBrite is also good about suggesting events in your area that might interest you.<br/>
<li>Email folks at         your company who might be interested<br/>
<li>Email friends and former colleagues and ask them to spread the word<br/>
<li>Post the event to your Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn profiles<br/>
<li>If you know of         any calendars that highlight local Tech events in your area, post         your meetup there. Likewise for any Tech email digests you may                 receive.<br/>
</ol><br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
Additional tips:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Get someone to record the event. Doesn't have to be professional quality – a Flip cam or SmartPhone can take perfectly usable video (just make sure they can record long enough!). Better yet, stream it live if         you can! Broadcasting makes the event accessible to the world, not just your community, and word will travel even farther! As well, future speakers can get an idea for how your group does things.<br/>
<li>Plan that ~50% of the people who RSVP won't make it. It's a free event, and plans         tend to change. Order food and drink accordingly.<br/>
<li>Remember that free food and BEvERages are strong motivators! Pizza, giant subs, or         other local favorite are great choices. For BEvERages, you're probably fine with beer, Coke and water.<br/>
<li>Bring a sign-in sheet and name tags (and pens).<br/>
<li>Consider asking the sponsor to bring SWAG or raffle off something cool (maybe even         their product or service).<br/>
<li>At the beginning or end of the meetup, ask attendees to suggest topics they want to         cover in future meetups. Or have them write down suggestions and put them in a box (then maybe raffle off a prize from the pool of contributors).<br/>
<li>Vary the format of your meetup – presentation, Birds of a Feather discussion, hackathon, lightning talks, white board night, Jenkins problem-solving session… all of these may interest your audience. If you can, switch the venue as well – that way people get to see other interesting companies, and can also choose to attend meetups that may be more convenient to them.<br/>
<li>Start and end on time. If things start to run over, you can always break and let people know they can go if they need to, but are welcome to stay if they like.<br/>
<li>Join forces with other groups when you can – this builds up both of your groups!         For example, host a joint Jenkins-Selenium group on the topic of Testing with Jenkins.<br/>

Last week, <a href="http://www.praqma.com/">praqma</a> was organizing in Copenhague a "Jenkins User Event". A User Event, compared to JenkinsConf, is a lighter meeting with (suposed to be) reduced costs organized by volunteers. Praqma got sponsorship from both <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> and <a href="http://www.programmingresearch.com/">Programing Research</a> so that they can book a high quality conference room and prepare a nice meeting with all commodities.<br /><br/>

Thursday was about a <a href="http://www.praqma.com/jcicodecamp12">Jenkins Code Camp</a> (aka "hackathon"), that I joined late at 2pm due to flight being delayed. 20 geeks were talking about some technical issues, new features, implementation strategies for a large set of topics. I contribute a group to solve an integration issue by <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/558">creating a new extension</a> point in jenkins-core. Those already confident with jenkins development helped to write this code, some discovered the extension point design as well as way to contribute to jenkins (github pull request, etc), some were looking at jenkins source code for first time so learned a lot.<br /><br/>

Friday was the Jenkins User Event. To reduce costs for such an event, compared to other Jenkins Conferences organized by CloudBees this year, lunch was not provided and conference program was "packed" into&nbsp;afternoon. This let praqma get a "reasonable" cost for this nice event, but still have a high quality conference, with printed programs, goodies, and coffee break. All praqma team was involved to make this event as pleasant as possible for all attendees, thanks a lot to them for contributing !<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Conference was sold-out on friday morning, with 80 attendees.<br /><br/>
<br style="clear: both;" /><br/>
After&nbsp;Lars Kruse&nbsp;welcome speak, and CloudBees to announce partnership with Praqma for DK, the conference started with two options : either an introduction to Jenkins, or an open-space discussion (~barcamp-like) for those that already know it well. I joined a small group first discussing about pre-tested commit, and then we divert speaking about best-practices, job and test performances issues, etc. Was a great exchange with interesting feedback.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
The rest of the conference was single-track.<br /><br/>

1rst session was about "<i>facilitate strategic reuse of software</i>" using jenkins CI. This session exposed how a industrial company changed it's internal software development practices and team organization to share components and be more efficient. This for sure introduced some coordinations and integration costs but resulted in a significant productivity improvement. This talk was interesting as it demonstrate that highly industrial companies (here, a low energy consuming water pumps producer) today follow development practice to share component and use continuous integration practice to help. I just wondered speaker said "Clearcase facilitated" sharing components &nbsp;-I wouldn't expected those two words in same sentence :P<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Tales from the trenches</i>" was a funny session explaining how Nokia came from stone age (manual integration with code freezes) to modern development practices. After reinventing the wheel with ~15 home made, perl-script based CI tools, they switched to Jenkins and Git as common tooling. Explanation on Git selection, evaluating multiple DVCS popularity, then migration from ClearCase,&nbsp;<u>helping a lot</u> early adopters, and later evaluating benefits (1 day / week / developer) was very interesting. Conclusion was that, "some tools a radically better" and "deep process renewal depends heavily on tools renewal".<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
"<i>Continuous Code Inspection</i>" talk explained use of industrial C++ coding standard and normative coding convention, with dedicated analysis tools. After explanation on those rules and tooling, a dedicated jenkins plugin was demonstrated. Such jenkins integration makes QA mostly a single checkbox to enable, and provide history graphs, reports, and external tools integration. Introduction was a little slow imho but content was demonstrating the power of jenkins plugin model to adapt software factory to specific industrial needs.<br /><br/>

<br /><br/>
Coffee break with delicious Danish chocolates ...<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Sony was presenting its "<i>Huge Jenkins Cluster</i>", with 4 master, some of them handling up to 6000 jobs, 300 slaves, 7000 builds a day an executing 175,000 tests a day for android platforms. Development teams use a dedicated slave machine with android devices connected through USB.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Such a build farm requires a dedicated support team and monitoring/maintenance tooling. IT only provides the computer and maintain the OS, but all Jenkins stuff is under the hands of a dedicated team. They evaluate plugins and core upgrades, educate teams, and analyse errors.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
With 45Gb for a single full android build, they have to monitor available disk space, and developed maintenance scripts to delete old build artifacts and cleanup /tmp. They also use a local git mirror to speed-up cloning, and integrated with CFEngine-managed infrastructure to ensure no update occurs as a slave is running a build. They also significantly optimized build speed by switching from NFS to SAN, and are now evaluating XFS.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Remaining issue is about jenkins build queue (subject discussed on Jenkins Code Camp) because a 9 in the morning, thousand users connect to jenkins master and the UI widget to expose the queue status hits the queue synchronisation bottleneck.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Next talk was mine, exposing <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb">Jenkins Enterprise</a> and demonstrating one ouf our Enterprise plugins. I'm not pleased by my talk, both because my english is crappy (maybe you already noticed?) and also because I was not confident with the standard JE slides. Assuming I had more time to prepare this talk, and as a tribute to this Danish event, I'd have used a bunch of lego bricks pictures to present Cloudbee plugins. So I quickly left the slides to run a demo, setting-up Jenkins Enterprise to run <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-validated-merge-plugin.cb">pre-tested commits</a>. Hope you enjoyed the talk.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s1600/IMAG0407.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mnHy9gx9uGw/UEyixY_2Q0I/AAAAAAAAHvI/_KDQbGOTjw8/s320/IMAG0407.jpg" width="240" /></a>Last talk was Lars one, exposing praqma "<i>Corporate approach to opensource</i>". This light, generalist talk was welcome as last one after a heavy-technical afternoon. Lars exposed reason to switch to open-source :<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>costs - for sure,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>but also open standards and interoperability,&nbsp;</li><br/>
<li>and contribution to public good.&nbsp;</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
This last point distinguish "<i>innovators</i>" that create new content and contribute to the oss project, and "<i>free riders</i>" that only want to save money and consume other efforts. Lars didn't went deeper into what "contributing" can be about, but spending some time joining the mailing lists, exposing detailled bug report, or writing blogs or documentation about the issues you encounter is already a huge contribution to opensource. Organizing such a great user event also is ;)<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
<br style="clear: both;" /><br/>
Meeting ended with a "socialize" time, sponsored by Pragmatic Research, with beer and sandwiches. A nice time to discuss with speakers, know a face to match an #irc nickname, discuss about everything geeks like to discuss about, and round off this pleasant day.<br />

<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference</a> is back to San Francisco after a world tour. The conference is on the 30th of this month (Sunday), which makes it back to back with JavaOne, just like the last year. This schedule allows the community people from all over the world to attend and talk, so you see speakers from <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JevgeniKabanov">different part</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#BaruchSadogursky">the world</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
You can see <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">the agenda and the speaker list here</a>, there's a number of speakers from the big/serious users of Jenkins in the bay area, such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JustinRyan">NetFlix</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#MaxSpring">Cisco</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#JamesBlair">HP</a>. All of these guys not only just use Jenkins but wrote additional plugins/programs to really tailor Jenkins into fitting their needs, and I think those would be really informative for those who are already using Jenkins, as well as those who are thinking about using Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This time we also have a couple of talks that discuss how to develop plugins. In JUC Israel, I was pleasantly surprised that a talk on this topic attracted a lot of people! If you are interested in writing a plugin, this would be a great chance to get started.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
We are also trying to bring <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda">the Jenkins project meeting</a>, which normally happens in IRC, into the real world in this conference. We are hoping that this would allow those who don't normally come to the meeting to voice their thoughts. If you are interested, feel free to add stuff to the agenda list!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And oh, did you check out who's on the sponsors list this year?<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I hope I convinced you that you must come to this conference &mdash; if so, <a href="http://juc-san-francisco-september-2012-eorg.eventbrite.com/">please register</a>. I've been told that right now you can use the promotion code <tt>JUC-2012SF</tt> to cut the price in half, so please use it while it still works!<br/>

<p>Recently, Jenkins User Conference organizer Alyssa Tong sent out the following request:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenkins User Conf SF is looking for volunteers to help us record the                                                                                        <br />
sessions. Pls drop me an email if you're able to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're trying to make sure we can capture video of as much of this year's conference as possible, but the only way we can do that is with your help!</p>

<p>If you'll be in town for JavaOne, or just live in the bay area, drop Alyssa an email at <code>atong@cloudbees.com</code>.</p>
