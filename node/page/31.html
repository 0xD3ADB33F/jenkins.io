Governance Meeting Today
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Amongst all the work this week with setting up project infrastructure, <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.396/">the first release of Jenkins</a> and a <em>flood</em> of developer activity <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">on GitHub</a>, the interim governance board has decided to hold periodic virtual meetings.</p>

<p>The first meeting will be held <strong>today</strong> at 3pm PST (23:00 UTC) in the <code>#jenkins</code> channel on IRC (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/">Kohsuke's</a> post to the mailing list, he further explained the goals of such meetings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use it to report/discuss various issues of the project (not bugs in code, but more project level stuff.) I also plan to report the infrastructure work that's done thus far.</p>

  <p>We'd like to hear from you, and the point is to engage the broader community, so please join us.</p>

  <p>This is a new thing, so it's not like we've figured this all out, but let's see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the Freenode <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat client</a> to join in, hope to see you there!

Jenkins!
</a>

<div class='content'>
<p>(This was sent as an email to the Hudson dev and users mailing lists after voting concluded, but I thought it'd be good to post it here as well.)</p>

<p>The vote is closed, and the results are in. More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-jenkins-vote">hudson-jenkins-vote</a>.
<!--break-->
So what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We've registered jenkins-ci.org, though it's empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">@jenkinsci</a>, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We're working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.</p>

<p>Putting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle's project, nor CloudBee's project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke's project - it's the community's project, and it's going to thrive.</p>

<a href='/blog/2011/01/11/hudsons-future/'>
Hudson's future
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>First, my apologies for the lack of updates on the <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">Hudson/Oracle situation</a> for
the last few weeks. While talks have been ongoing, the holidays have slowed
things down, and we didn't want to send out information that would later turn
out not to be true. We've been waiting for the talks to reach a resolution -
and I believe they now have.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.java.net">java.net</a> migration problems, Oracle and representatives from the
Hudson community have been involved in talks on the future of the project in a
number of areas. The Hudson representatives have been <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">myself</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke
Kawaguchi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a>  (CEO of CloudBees and Kohsuke's boss), who was
brought in to help provide experience with discussions on a corporate/executive
level which neither Kohsuke nor I have, with Alan Harder and <a href="http://twitter.com/agentdero">R. Tyler Croy</a>
advising on the side.</p>

<p>These talks have in many ways been fruitful - we came to working agreements
with Oracle on the project infrastructure (such as mailing lists and SCM
repository location), code review policy for Hudson core, and perhaps most
significantly, a governance structure for the project going forward. Some
issues are not yet entirely resolved, such as questions on restrictions on
third party dependency licenses. But one issue, which we feel is the most
significant issue of all, one for which we now believe no resolution is
possible: the rights to the name <strong>Hudson</strong>.</p>

<p>Oracle has told us that they have trademark applications filed in both the EU
and US for Hudson, based on Hudson's creation by Kohsuke while working at Sun.
The problem is that this trademark ownership gives Oracle the ability to revoke
the Hudson project's right to call itself Hudson at any time, and while Oracle
has made an attempt to offer some guarantees (most notably, that binary
releases of Hudson, once they've been released with the name Hudson attached,
will always retain the right to the name), they are not offering any binding
guarantee that the Hudson project will be able to retain its use of the name in
perpetuity.</p>

<p>Therefore, to continue using the name Hudson means ceding some of the project's
independence to Oracle - if the project and its governance board opted to go in
a direction Oracle disapproved of, Oracle would be able to take away the naming
rights. Or, in a less dramatic scenario, Oracle could insist on certain changes
to the code, infrastructure decisions, process, etc, regardless of opposition
from the Hudson development community, in order to retain the rights to the
name.</p>

<p>In short, we'd be living under a sword of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Damocles">Damocles</a>, regardless of the goodwill
of the individuals we've been negotiating with at Oracle - Hudson as a project
would be beholden to Oracle's whims for its continued use of its own name, and
we believe that's not viable.
<!--break-->
As I see it, the only viable option facing the project now is to rename it, in
order to free it from the burden of Oracle's ownership of its name. This is not
a first choice, not by a long shot, but I don't see any other choice available
to us that would preserve the integrity of the project going forward. Oracle
will be presenting their proposal for the project continuing under their
umbrella - I encourage you to read it when it becomes available and weigh it
accordingly. I'll just focus on what Kohsuke, other prominent Hudson community
members and I have endorsed.</p>

<h3 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h3>

<p>First, we rename the project - the choice for a new name is <strong>Jenkins</strong>, which we
think evokes the same sort of English butler feel as Hudson. We've already
registered domains, Twitter users, etc for the new name, and have done our best
to verify that there are no existing trademarks which would conflict with it.
Kohsuke will be registering the trademark for Jenkins in his name, with the
intent of transferring ownership of the trademark to the umbrella of the
<a href="http://www.sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> once the Jenkins project has been admitted to it
(which, I should add, is very much our plan, hopefully in their next round of
new projects in a few months - we've already had preliminary contacts with
SFC). We still invite Oracle to remain involved with the project, on equal
terms with all other contributors, and hope they'll take us up on this
invitation.</p>

<p>Second, out of respect for Oracle's trademark claim on Hudson, we will move our
infrastructure off of Oracle-owned and hosted servers, and we will rename
existing independent components of the infrastructure to no longer use "Hudson"
- i.e., mailing lists, Github repos, etc. This would be a gradual process,
obviously.</p>

<p>Third, we will put in place an interim governance board for the project,
consisting of three members - myself, Kohsuke and, if Oracle elects to remain
involved, Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer working on Hudson. The interim
board members will serve for the next 3-6 months, until the governance
structure can be nailed down securely enough to hold elections for the board
members.</p>

<p>Obviously, such a move could not be undertaken without the agreement and
support of the Hudson community. We believe this proposal is the best choice
for the project in the situation it's currently in, but we aren't closing off
discussion, questions, etc, and we encourage your feedback and comments. If
there's anything you need clarified, please ask and we'll do our best to
answer.</p>

<p>Once Oracle's proposal is available later this week (hopefully Wednesday,
possibly Thursday, from what I've been told), which I strongly advise you all to 
read and consider, we'll be putting up a poll to determine the position of the 
community. Once that vote is done, assuming the consensus is to rename, we'll 
put the mechanisms in motion and switch over as fast we can.</p>

<p>There may be some confusion as to whether we're proposing to fork Hudson, or
rename the existing project. I firmly believe we are proposing the latter - for
me, the project's key component is Kohsuke himself. If the community decides to
support renaming the project to Jenkins, and Oracle chooses to continue
development themselves under the name Hudson, they are, obviously, entirely
welcome to do so. But with Kohsuke working on Jenkins, that's the true home and
the future of the project for me, regardless of the name.</p>

Installing plugins has always been easy, now it's fast too!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As one of the "men behind the scenes" of the Hudson project, a lot of my contributions tend to be in writing articles or handling infrastructure, anything to ensure folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> can continue to make Hudson great without being distracted by inane system administration tasks. This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has finally "gone live," making downloads of plugins and packages faster than ever!</p>

<p>Some number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson's infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a <strong>huge</strong> number of Hudson users and developers who are both in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>After discussing things with some of the folks that run <a href="http://download.opensuse.org">download.opensuse.org</a>, a <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a> powered redirector, I set out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily managed and help direct users' downloads to the geographically closest and fastest mirror available.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-we-mirrored">Where are we mirrored?</h4>

<p>Currently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and one overseas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwest U.S. (Utah) - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.xmission.com">XMission</a></em></li>
  <li>Midwest U.S. (Chicago) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Northeast U.S. (New York City) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Germany - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.aragost.com/">aragost Trifork ag</a></em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="using-the-mirrors">Using the mirrors</h4>

<p>If you've updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess what! You're already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch on January 7th, over <strong>800</strong> plugins and <strong>600</strong> <code>hudson.war</code> updates have been downloaded from the mirroring network!
<!--break-->
If you'd like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on over to <a href="http://mirrors.hudson-labs.org">mirrors.hudson-labs.org</a>, which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate mirror based on your IP address. It's just that easy!</p>

<p>We are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors, hopefully we'll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and if we're lucky, we'll find some more European mirrors too.</p>

<hr />

<p>I would like to thank the <strong>immensely</strong> helpful and supportive engineers over at the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> for offering gratis tech support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our <em>primary</em> mirror.</p>

Weekend Update with Andrew Bayer
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>[<strong>Ed. note</strong> <em>Andrew was not involved in selecting this post's title - rtyler</em>]</p>

<p>I wanted to give the Hudson community a quick update on the current status of the issues Tyler has <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">discussed in the earlier posts</a> here.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a> and myself jumped on a conference call with Hudson contributor/Oracle employee <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, Oracle manager Denis Tyrell and of course Ted Farrell.</p>

<p>We discussed a wide range of issues relating to the Hudson project, such as governance, the rights to the name Hudson, and the infrastructure hosting the Hudson project. While we didn't agree on resolutions to all issues, I feel real progress was made towards a framework that provides what the Hudson community needs while also preventing the sort of conflicts we've seen the last week or two.</p>

<p>More work has to be done - we'll be talking again next week, and I'm hoping we can reach agreement on the contentious issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

Hudson and the work we've been doing. The Hudson community in general has
always been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from
friends and users who've not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.</p>

<p>That said, let's get down to business. As <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">I covered
yesterday</a> there is some
bubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project
infrastructure decisions and Oracle's reactions to them. If you can't spare the
time to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to
move codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks
ensue).</p>

<p>While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are
debating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best
suits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke
or Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of
the options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a <strong>very</strong> big project with some fairly unique needs. We have <em>hundreds</em> of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We've been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we're covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don't come up again for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want
to make sure that it's clear that this <em>is not</em> about "Us versus Oracle."</p>

<p>Our goal isn't to "stick it to the man," that doesn't help make Hudson any better.</p>

<p>Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to
participate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration
server available.</p>

<p>Stay tuned :)

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-60to79.gif" align="right" />There's been a lot of discussion on the <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/new-hudson-mailing-lists">new mailing lists</a> as of late regarding some of the infrastructure and ownership of the Hudson project. In case you haven't been following along at home, I'll try to catch you up as impartially as possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-facts">The Facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2009.06.02</strong>: After substantial problems with Java.net infrastructure, the
<a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278.html">dev community discusses new infrastructure
options</a>,
including SourceForge, Google Code, Kenai, Berlios, GitHub, etc. Instead of
moving the entire project, some key components such as the
<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> are moved off of
Java.net. Discussions about moving source code off of Java.net and onto other hosts like
GitHub come up almost every four months on the mailing lists, typically
coinciding with serious Java.net downtime or reliability issues..</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.01</strong>: A discussion occurs on the developers mailing list about
adding <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, the Oracle engineer re-assigned to replace <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> (Hudson
founder/lead developer), as a co-owner to the Java.net project. Winston
mentions that his question was driven by Oracle management who felt he should
"co-own the project." After a round of discussion, it's decided by the devs
list that it's acceptable and grants Winston co-ownership of the project as a
sign of good faith from the community towards Oracle.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.17</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">Andrew Bayer</a>, core contributor
and maintainer of numerous plugins emails the users and devs list with a
proposal to move the mailing lists off of Java.net which has had notorious
reliability issues within the Java ecosystem and was scheduled for a series of
downtimes and migrations over the coming weeks. Google Groups is selected as the
most reasonable by the community.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.19</strong>: Hudson project is lumped into the same Java.net migration bucket as Glassfish. Emails are sent to project owners, the users and the developers list. The mail to users and developers never arrives due to the sender not being subscribed. Both project owners (Kohsuke, Winston) miss the message, leaving the Hudson community in the dark regarding the pending migration.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.22</strong>: Shortly after midnight, Jacob Robertson reports that his
SVN credentials no longer work, Kohsuke informs the developers list that the project is
locked due to the migration, SVN is inaccessible and mailing lists fail shortly after that. <img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-40to59.gif" align="right" />The Hudson Java.net project
begins its migration from the legacy infrastructure to the newer
Java.net infrastructure (formerly known as "Kenai"). A group of core Hudson
community members accelerate the move to Google Groups, pushing out
announcements via <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/new-hudson-mailing-lists">this
blog</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">twitter</a> hoping to keep as many members in the
loop as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.23</strong>: Frustrated by the locking down of Hudson's source code,
which sees between 3-8 commits to "core" a day, not counting the 300+
plugins, Kohsuke <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/8d3cf0ca1240280a">proposes moving to
GitHub</a>
on the new developers mailing list. The general consensus amongst the plugin
and core developers was to go forward with moving to GitHub, no major
objections were raised by the developer community.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.27</strong>: After Thanksgiving, Andrew Bayer submits the "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/c935a4740af0b920">formal
proposal</a>"
for migrating over to GitHub, Sets a deadline of the following tuesday
(2010.11.30) for raising any major objections before "flipping the switch."</li>
</ul>

<p>The Monday morning prior to the planned switchover to GitHub, Oracle Senior VP
of Tools and Middleware <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/Spokespeople/016474">Ted
Farrell</a> sent <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438">a
message to the users list</a> expressing concerns he had regarding the migration of
the Hudson codebase from Java.net to GitHub:
<!--break-->
&gt; <em>Oracle's goal is to grow the community and make hudson stronger.  You
&gt; all might not be aware of this, but the actual hudson user base is
&gt; very large.  Much bigger than what you see on the mailing lists or in
&gt; the forums.  The unfortunate part of that is how many of these users
&gt; do not contribute to the core, and do not participate in these
&gt; discussions.  They want to do that, but don't feel like they can be
&gt; heard.  We want them to be heard.  We need to make the hudson
&gt; community a place that will welcome all the hudson users and encourage
&gt; its growth and longevity.  We will be announcing some changes in the
&gt; upcoming weeks that we believe will foster that.
&gt;
&gt; For now, however, we are going to stay on the java.net
&gt; infrastructure.  We believe it is important for hudson to stay
&gt; connected with the rest of the the java community, as well as take
&gt; advantage of some of the cool changes we will have coming to
&gt; java.net.  Moving to GIT can be done while staying on java.net.  It is
&gt; not a requirement to move to github.
&gt;
&gt; …
&gt;
&gt; Because it is open source, we can't stop anybody from forking it.  We
&gt; do however own the trademark to the name so you cannot use the name
&gt; outside of the core community.  We acquired that as part of Sun.  We
&gt; hope that everyone working on hudson today will do as they claim to
&gt; want, and work with us to make hudson stronger.</em></p>

<p>(Ted's message was rather long, you can read the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438">whole
post here</a>)</p>

<p>As one might expect, Ted's response to the thread was received with
mixed responses ranging from general confusion to obvious frustration.</p>

<p>Long time contributor to Hudson's Git plugin, <a href="https://github.com/magnayn">Nigel Magnay</a> tried to clarify the benefits of migrating to GitHub instead of using Git on the "new" Java.net as succinctly as possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just having git support != git support on github. They work full time on
providing the best community development tools; I doubt kenai could even
catch up, let alone surpass what they're doing.</em></p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>I'm confused.</p>

  <p>What things are you saying you will not let the Hudson developer community
do?</p>

  <p>I.E: Are you saying that, as the holders of the Hudson 'name', you are
prohibiting the developer community from choosing (for ourselves) to migrate
the infrastructure (bug tracking / wiki)? The repositories ?</p>

  <p>So far the response from the developers has been pretty strongly in favour
of the migration to google groups for mail, to github for code repositories
and collaboration, and to a self-hosted site for bug tracking and
information.&lt;/em&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-20to39.gif" align="right" />
Ted's response to Nigel contained one of the most important nugget of
information for the whole discussion nestled in the middle of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/5540655e05ef2982">the message</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Nigel, what I am saying is that I believe the <em>final</em> decision of what
to do w.r.t. infrastructure belongs to Oracle and that decision should
be made according to the will of the community as it makes sense</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-part-where-i-editorialize">The part where I editorialize</h2>

<p>I readily admit, there is a lot of information to take in here, for clarification there are two distinct "communities" involved in Hudson:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>developers</strong>: the <em>hundreds</em> of developers actively communicating on the
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev">developers list</a> and
  contributing to the 300+ plugins</li>
  <li><strong>users</strong>: tens of thousands of individuals and companies using Hudson
either as a straight <code>.war</code> file, or using the native packages provided by
the community</li>
</ul>

<p>The fundamental issue here is that the <strong>developers</strong> want to make a change in
how <em>they</em> contribute to Hudson, and have made their voices heard to that end.
From the users' perspective, such a change would have literally <strong>zero</strong> impact
on them, which makes Oracle's conflation of the two sides of Hudson
particularly frustrating.</p>

<p>Part of the impasse between Oracle management and the developer community lies
in an inherent meritocracy in any large open source project, whether it be the
Linux kernel, the Python language and runtime, or the PostgreSQL database
server, those that contribute carry more weight within the community
<strong>because</strong> they are actively pushing things forward. On top of that, Oracle
continues to cite a "larger community" that's apparently larger than those
active committing to Hudson on a daily or weekly basis, without naming names or
citing specific contributions.</p>

<p>Ted, and in turn, Oracle's approach to the Hudson community seems to stem from
a systematic misunderstanding of how most (if not all) major open source
projects operate. Mentiong closed-door meetings between Sonatype and Oracle
regarding "how to make Hudson better" do nothing to aid many developers'
concerns about Oracle's commitment to Hudson as an open source project or a
community.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, we are being told one thing while Oracle's actions speak
to another. Insisting that Hudson development remain on Java.net, after the
development community committed to GitHub, contradicts the words promising to
work with the Hudson community and to help facilitate its growth. Asserting
that Oracle isn't trying to exert unwelcome control over the project, while
doing exactly that.</p>

<p>Personally, I do want Oracle to continue to be involved, along with CloudBees,
Sonatype and many other companies that contribute to the ever-growing Hudson
ecosystem. The involvement of a plethora of different companies only helps
emphasize the importance of Hudson to the developer community and underline the
value of Hudson as a community owned and operated project.</p>

<p>December will be an interesting month, stay tuned.</p>

New Hudson Mailing Lists!

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/duke-construction.gif" alt="Duke is not amused :(" align="right" />As Kohsuke <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/javanet-migration-status-update">mentioned in this post</a>, the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the Hudson community.</p>

<p>The tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine frustrating both for the core developers but <strong>hundreds</strong> of plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the planet.</p>

<p>For <strong>source code</strong> we're working on getting something in place for contributions on <a href="https://github.com/hudson/hudson">GitHub</a> thanks to some assistance from the GitHub team.</p>

<p>For <strong>mailing lists</strong> we've gone ahead and dumped Java.net mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/">hudson-dev</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/">hudson-users</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-commits/">hudson-commits</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-issues/">hudson-issues</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, you <strong>do not need a Google account</strong> to subscribe to these lists, else we wouldn't have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an email to "hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com" and you'll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.</p>

<p>Since our <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> isn't actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they <em>should</em> continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.</p>

<p>I apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we're likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.
