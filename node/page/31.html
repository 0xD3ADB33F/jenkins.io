Governance Meeting Today
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Amongst all the work this week with setting up project infrastructure, <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.396/">the first release of Jenkins</a> and a <em>flood</em> of developer activity <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">on GitHub</a>, the interim governance board has decided to hold periodic virtual meetings.</p>

<p>The first meeting will be held <strong>today</strong> at 3pm PST (23:00 UTC) in the <code>#jenkins</code> channel on IRC (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/">Kohsuke's</a> post to the mailing list, he further explained the goals of such meetings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use it to report/discuss various issues of the project (not bugs in code, but more project level stuff.) I also plan to report the infrastructure work that's done thus far.</p>

  <p>We'd like to hear from you, and the point is to engage the broader community, so please join us.</p>

  <p>This is a new thing, so it's not like we've figured this all out, but let's see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the Freenode <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat client</a> to join in, hope to see you there!

Jenkins!

<p>(This was sent as an email to the Hudson dev and users mailing lists after voting concluded, but I thought it'd be good to post it here as well.)</p>

<p>The vote is closed, and the results are in. More than half of the total votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-jenkins-vote">hudson-jenkins-vote</a>.
<!--break-->
So what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We've registered jenkins-ci.org, though it's empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*@googlegroups.com, renaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">@jenkinsci</a>, and renaming our organization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these lists. We're working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next couple days.</p>

<p>Putting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle's project, nor CloudBee's project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke's project - it's the community's project, and it's going to thrive.</p>

Hudson's future
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>First, my apologies for the lack of updates on the <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">Hudson/Oracle situation</a> for
the last few weeks. While talks have been ongoing, the holidays have slowed
things down, and we didn't want to send out information that would later turn
out not to be true. We've been waiting for the talks to reach a resolution -
and I believe they now have.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.java.net">java.net</a> migration problems, Oracle and representatives from the
Hudson community have been involved in talks on the future of the project in a
number of areas. The Hudson representatives have been <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">myself</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke
Kawaguchi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a>  (CEO of CloudBees and Kohsuke's boss), who was
brought in to help provide experience with discussions on a corporate/executive
level which neither Kohsuke nor I have, with Alan Harder and <a href="http://twitter.com/agentdero">R. Tyler Croy</a>
advising on the side.</p>

<p>These talks have in many ways been fruitful - we came to working agreements
with Oracle on the project infrastructure (such as mailing lists and SCM
repository location), code review policy for Hudson core, and perhaps most
significantly, a governance structure for the project going forward. Some
issues are not yet entirely resolved, such as questions on restrictions on
third party dependency licenses. But one issue, which we feel is the most
significant issue of all, one for which we now believe no resolution is
possible: the rights to the name <strong>Hudson</strong>.</p>

<p>Oracle has told us that they have trademark applications filed in both the EU
and US for Hudson, based on Hudson's creation by Kohsuke while working at Sun.
The problem is that this trademark ownership gives Oracle the ability to revoke
the Hudson project's right to call itself Hudson at any time, and while Oracle
has made an attempt to offer some guarantees (most notably, that binary
releases of Hudson, once they've been released with the name Hudson attached,
will always retain the right to the name), they are not offering any binding
guarantee that the Hudson project will be able to retain its use of the name in
perpetuity.</p>

<p>Therefore, to continue using the name Hudson means ceding some of the project's
independence to Oracle - if the project and its governance board opted to go in
a direction Oracle disapproved of, Oracle would be able to take away the naming
rights. Or, in a less dramatic scenario, Oracle could insist on certain changes
to the code, infrastructure decisions, process, etc, regardless of opposition
from the Hudson development community, in order to retain the rights to the
name.</p>

<p>In short, we'd be living under a sword of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Damocles">Damocles</a>, regardless of the goodwill
of the individuals we've been negotiating with at Oracle - Hudson as a project
would be beholden to Oracle's whims for its continued use of its own name, and
we believe that's not viable.
<!--break-->
As I see it, the only viable option facing the project now is to rename it, in
order to free it from the burden of Oracle's ownership of its name. This is not
a first choice, not by a long shot, but I don't see any other choice available
to us that would preserve the integrity of the project going forward. Oracle
will be presenting their proposal for the project continuing under their
umbrella - I encourage you to read it when it becomes available and weigh it
accordingly. I'll just focus on what Kohsuke, other prominent Hudson community
members and I have endorsed.</p>

<h3 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h3>

<p>First, we rename the project - the choice for a new name is <strong>Jenkins</strong>, which we
think evokes the same sort of English butler feel as Hudson. We've already
registered domains, Twitter users, etc for the new name, and have done our best
to verify that there are no existing trademarks which would conflict with it.
Kohsuke will be registering the trademark for Jenkins in his name, with the
intent of transferring ownership of the trademark to the umbrella of the
<a href="http://www.sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> once the Jenkins project has been admitted to it
(which, I should add, is very much our plan, hopefully in their next round of
new projects in a few months - we've already had preliminary contacts with
SFC). We still invite Oracle to remain involved with the project, on equal
terms with all other contributors, and hope they'll take us up on this
invitation.</p>

<p>Second, out of respect for Oracle's trademark claim on Hudson, we will move our
infrastructure off of Oracle-owned and hosted servers, and we will rename
existing independent components of the infrastructure to no longer use "Hudson"
- i.e., mailing lists, Github repos, etc. This would be a gradual process,
obviously.</p>

<p>Third, we will put in place an interim governance board for the project,
consisting of three members - myself, Kohsuke and, if Oracle elects to remain
involved, Winston Prakash, the Oracle engineer working on Hudson. The interim
board members will serve for the next 3-6 months, until the governance
structure can be nailed down securely enough to hold elections for the board
members.</p>

<p>Obviously, such a move could not be undertaken without the agreement and
support of the Hudson community. We believe this proposal is the best choice
for the project in the situation it's currently in, but we aren't closing off
discussion, questions, etc, and we encourage your feedback and comments. If
there's anything you need clarified, please ask and we'll do our best to
answer.</p>

<p>Once Oracle's proposal is available later this week (hopefully Wednesday,
possibly Thursday, from what I've been told), which I strongly advise you all to 
read and consider, we'll be putting up a poll to determine the position of the 
community. Once that vote is done, assuming the consensus is to rename, we'll 
put the mechanisms in motion and switch over as fast we can.</p>

<p>There may be some confusion as to whether we're proposing to fork Hudson, or
rename the existing project. I firmly believe we are proposing the latter - for
me, the project's key component is Kohsuke himself. If the community decides to
support renaming the project to Jenkins, and Oracle chooses to continue
development themselves under the name Hudson, they are, obviously, entirely
welcome to do so. But with Kohsuke working on Jenkins, that's the true home and
the future of the project for me, regardless of the name.</p>

Installing plugins has always been easy, now it's fast too!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As one of the "men behind the scenes" of the Hudson project, a lot of my contributions tend to be in writing articles or handling infrastructure, anything to ensure folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> can continue to make Hudson great without being distracted by inane system administration tasks. This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has finally "gone live," making downloads of plugins and packages faster than ever!</p>

<p>Some number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson's infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a <strong>huge</strong> number of Hudson users and developers who are both in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>After discussing things with some of the folks that run <a href="http://download.opensuse.org">download.opensuse.org</a>, a <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a> powered redirector, I set out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily managed and help direct users' downloads to the geographically closest and fastest mirror available.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-we-mirrored">Where are we mirrored?</h4>

<p>Currently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and one overseas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwest U.S. (Utah) - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.xmission.com">XMission</a></em></li>
  <li>Midwest U.S. (Chicago) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Northeast U.S. (New York City) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Germany - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.aragost.com/">aragost Trifork ag</a></em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="using-the-mirrors">Using the mirrors</h4>

<p>If you've updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess what! You're already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch on January 7th, over <strong>800</strong> plugins and <strong>600</strong> <code>hudson.war</code> updates have been downloaded from the mirroring network!
<!--break-->
If you'd like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on over to <a href="http://mirrors.hudson-labs.org">mirrors.hudson-labs.org</a>, which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate mirror based on your IP address. It's just that easy!</p>

<p>We are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors, hopefully we'll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and if we're lucky, we'll find some more European mirrors too.</p>

<hr />

<p>I would like to thank the <strong>immensely</strong> helpful and supportive engineers over at the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> for offering gratis tech support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our <em>primary</em> mirror.</p>

Weekend Update with Andrew Bayer
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>[<strong>Ed. note</strong> <em>Andrew was not involved in selecting this post's title - rtyler</em>]</p>

<p>I wanted to give the Hudson community a quick update on the current status of the issues Tyler has <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">discussed in the earlier posts</a> here.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a> and myself jumped on a conference call with Hudson contributor/Oracle employee <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, Oracle manager Denis Tyrell and of course Ted Farrell.</p>

<p>We discussed a wide range of issues relating to the Hudson project, such as governance, the rights to the name Hudson, and the infrastructure hosting the Hudson project. While we didn't agree on resolutions to all issues, I feel real progress was made towards a framework that provides what the Hudson community needs while also preventing the sort of conflicts we've seen the last week or two.</p>

<p>More work has to be done - we'll be talking again next week, and I'm hoping we can reach agreement on the contentious issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
