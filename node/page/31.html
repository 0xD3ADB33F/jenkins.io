Installing plugins has always been easy, now it's fast too!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>As one of the "men behind the scenes" of the Hudson project, a lot of my contributions tend to be in writing articles or handling infrastructure, anything to ensure folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> can continue to make Hudson great without being distracted by inane system administration tasks. This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has finally "gone live," making downloads of plugins and packages faster than ever!</p>

<p>Some number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson's infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a <strong>huge</strong> number of Hudson users and developers who are both in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>After discussing things with some of the folks that run <a href="http://download.opensuse.org">download.opensuse.org</a>, a <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a> powered redirector, I set out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily managed and help direct users' downloads to the geographically closest and fastest mirror available.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-we-mirrored">Where are we mirrored?</h4>

<p>Currently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and one overseas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwest U.S. (Utah) - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.xmission.com">XMission</a></em></li>
  <li>Midwest U.S. (Chicago) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Northeast U.S. (New York City) - <em>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a></em></li>
  <li>Germany - <em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.aragost.com/">aragost Trifork ag</a></em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="using-the-mirrors">Using the mirrors</h4>

<p>If you've updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess what! You're already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch on January 7th, over <strong>800</strong> plugins and <strong>600</strong> <code>hudson.war</code> updates have been downloaded from the mirroring network!
<!--break-->
If you'd like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on over to <a href="http://mirrors.hudson-labs.org">mirrors.hudson-labs.org</a>, which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate mirror based on your IP address. It's just that easy!</p>

<p>We are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors, hopefully we'll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and if we're lucky, we'll find some more European mirrors too.</p>

<hr />

<p>I would like to thank the <strong>immensely</strong> helpful and supportive engineers over at the <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> for offering gratis tech support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our <em>primary</em> mirror.</p>

Weekend Update with Andrew Bayer
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>[<strong>Ed. note</strong> <em>Andrew was not involved in selecting this post's title - rtyler</em>]</p>

<p>I wanted to give the Hudson community a quick update on the current status of the issues Tyler has <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">discussed in the earlier posts</a> here.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a> and myself jumped on a conference call with Hudson contributor/Oracle employee <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, Oracle manager Denis Tyrell and of course Ted Farrell.</p>

<p>We discussed a wide range of issues relating to the Hudson project, such as governance, the rights to the name Hudson, and the infrastructure hosting the Hudson project. While we didn't agree on resolutions to all issues, I feel real progress was made towards a framework that provides what the Hudson community needs while also preventing the sort of conflicts we've seen the last week or two.</p>

<p>More work has to be done - we'll be talking again next week, and I'm hoping we can reach agreement on the contentious issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<a href='/blog/2010/12/01/a-brief-update/'>
A brief update
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Let me be the first to say <strong>thank you all</strong> for your <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hudson-labs.org%2Fcontent%2Fwhos-driving-thing%2F">overwhelming support</a> for
Hudson and the work we've been doing. The Hudson community in general has
always been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from
friends and users who've not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.</p>

<p>That said, let's get down to business. As <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing">I covered
yesterday</a> there is some
bubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project
infrastructure decisions and Oracle's reactions to them. If you can't spare the
time to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to
move codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks
ensue).</p>

<p>While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are
debating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best
suits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke
or Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of
the options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a <strong>very</strong> big project with some fairly unique needs. We have <em>hundreds</em> of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We've been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we're covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don't come up again for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want
to make sure that it's clear that this <em>is not</em> about "Us versus Oracle."</p>

<p>Our goal isn't to "stick it to the man," that doesn't help make Hudson any better.</p>

<p>Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to
participate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration
server available.</p>

<p>Stay tuned :)

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-60to79.gif" align="right" />There's been a lot of discussion on the <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/new-hudson-mailing-lists">new mailing lists</a> as of late regarding some of the infrastructure and ownership of the Hudson project. In case you haven't been following along at home, I'll try to catch you up as impartially as possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-facts">The Facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2009.06.02</strong>: After substantial problems with Java.net infrastructure, the
<a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278.html">dev community discusses new infrastructure
options</a>,
including SourceForge, Google Code, Kenai, Berlios, GitHub, etc. Instead of
moving the entire project, some key components such as the
<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> are moved off of
Java.net. Discussions about moving source code off of Java.net and onto other hosts like
GitHub come up almost every four months on the mailing lists, typically
coinciding with serious Java.net downtime or reliability issues..</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.01</strong>: A discussion occurs on the developers mailing list about
adding <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, the Oracle engineer re-assigned to replace <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> (Hudson
founder/lead developer), as a co-owner to the Java.net project. Winston
mentions that his question was driven by Oracle management who felt he should
"co-own the project." After a round of discussion, it's decided by the devs
list that it's acceptable and grants Winston co-ownership of the project as a
sign of good faith from the community towards Oracle.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.17</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">Andrew Bayer</a>, core contributor
and maintainer of numerous plugins emails the users and devs list with a
proposal to move the mailing lists off of Java.net which has had notorious
reliability issues within the Java ecosystem and was scheduled for a series of
downtimes and migrations over the coming weeks. Google Groups is selected as the
most reasonable by the community.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.19</strong>: Hudson project is lumped into the same Java.net migration bucket as Glassfish. Emails are sent to project owners, the users and the developers list. The mail to users and developers never arrives due to the sender not being subscribed. Both project owners (Kohsuke, Winston) miss the message, leaving the Hudson community in the dark regarding the pending migration.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.22</strong>: Shortly after midnight, Jacob Robertson reports that his
SVN credentials no longer work, Kohsuke informs the developers list that the project is
locked due to the migration, SVN is inaccessible and mailing lists fail shortly after that. <img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-40to59.gif" align="right" />The Hudson Java.net project
begins its migration from the legacy infrastructure to the newer
Java.net infrastructure (formerly known as "Kenai"). A group of core Hudson
community members accelerate the move to Google Groups, pushing out
announcements via <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/new-hudson-mailing-lists">this
blog</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci">twitter</a> hoping to keep as many members in the
loop as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.23</strong>: Frustrated by the locking down of Hudson's source code,
which sees between 3-8 commits to "core" a day, not counting the 300+
plugins, Kohsuke <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/8d3cf0ca1240280a">proposes moving to
GitHub</a>
on the new developers mailing list. The general consensus amongst the plugin
and core developers was to go forward with moving to GitHub, no major
objections were raised by the developer community.</li>
  <li><strong>2010.11.27</strong>: After Thanksgiving, Andrew Bayer submits the "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/c935a4740af0b920">formal
proposal</a>"
for migrating over to GitHub, Sets a deadline of the following tuesday
(2010.11.30) for raising any major objections before "flipping the switch."</li>
</ul>

<p>The Monday morning prior to the planned switchover to GitHub, Oracle Senior VP
of Tools and Middleware <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/Spokespeople/016474">Ted
Farrell</a> sent <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438">a
message to the users list</a> expressing concerns he had regarding the migration of
the Hudson codebase from Java.net to GitHub:
<!--break-->
&gt; <em>Oracle's goal is to grow the community and make hudson stronger.  You
&gt; all might not be aware of this, but the actual hudson user base is
&gt; very large.  Much bigger than what you see on the mailing lists or in
&gt; the forums.  The unfortunate part of that is how many of these users
&gt; do not contribute to the core, and do not participate in these
&gt; discussions.  They want to do that, but don't feel like they can be
&gt; heard.  We want them to be heard.  We need to make the hudson
&gt; community a place that will welcome all the hudson users and encourage
&gt; its growth and longevity.  We will be announcing some changes in the
&gt; upcoming weeks that we believe will foster that.
&gt;
&gt; For now, however, we are going to stay on the java.net
&gt; infrastructure.  We believe it is important for hudson to stay
&gt; connected with the rest of the the java community, as well as take
&gt; advantage of some of the cool changes we will have coming to
&gt; java.net.  Moving to GIT can be done while staying on java.net.  It is
&gt; not a requirement to move to github.
&gt;
&gt; …
&gt;
&gt; Because it is open source, we can't stop anybody from forking it.  We
&gt; do however own the trademark to the name so you cannot use the name
&gt; outside of the core community.  We acquired that as part of Sun.  We
&gt; hope that everyone working on hudson today will do as they claim to
&gt; want, and work with us to make hudson stronger.</em></p>

<p>(Ted's message was rather long, you can read the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438">whole
post here</a>)</p>

<p>As one might expect, Ted's response to the thread was received with
mixed responses ranging from general confusion to obvious frustration.</p>

<p>Long time contributor to Hudson's Git plugin, <a href="https://github.com/magnayn">Nigel Magnay</a> tried to clarify the benefits of migrating to GitHub instead of using Git on the "new" Java.net as succinctly as possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just having git support != git support on github. They work full time on
providing the best community development tools; I doubt kenai could even
catch up, let alone surpass what they're doing.</em></p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>I'm confused.</p>

  <p>What things are you saying you will not let the Hudson developer community
do?</p>

  <p>I.E: Are you saying that, as the holders of the Hudson 'name', you are
prohibiting the developer community from choosing (for ourselves) to migrate
the infrastructure (bug tracking / wiki)? The repositories ?</p>

  <p>So far the response from the developers has been pretty strongly in favour
of the migration to google groups for mail, to github for code repositories
and collaboration, and to a self-hosted site for bug tracking and
information.&lt;/em&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-20to39.gif" align="right" />
Ted's response to Nigel contained one of the most important nugget of
information for the whole discussion nestled in the middle of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/5540655e05ef2982">the message</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Nigel, what I am saying is that I believe the <em>final</em> decision of what
to do w.r.t. infrastructure belongs to Oracle and that decision should
be made according to the will of the community as it makes sense</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-part-where-i-editorialize">The part where I editorialize</h2>

<p>I readily admit, there is a lot of information to take in here, for clarification there are two distinct "communities" involved in Hudson:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>developers</strong>: the <em>hundreds</em> of developers actively communicating on the
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev">developers list</a> and
  contributing to the 300+ plugins</li>
  <li><strong>users</strong>: tens of thousands of individuals and companies using Hudson
either as a straight <code>.war</code> file, or using the native packages provided by
the community</li>
</ul>

<p>The fundamental issue here is that the <strong>developers</strong> want to make a change in
how <em>they</em> contribute to Hudson, and have made their voices heard to that end.
From the users' perspective, such a change would have literally <strong>zero</strong> impact
on them, which makes Oracle's conflation of the two sides of Hudson
particularly frustrating.</p>

<p>Part of the impasse between Oracle management and the developer community lies
in an inherent meritocracy in any large open source project, whether it be the
Linux kernel, the Python language and runtime, or the PostgreSQL database
server, those that contribute carry more weight within the community
<strong>because</strong> they are actively pushing things forward. On top of that, Oracle
continues to cite a "larger community" that's apparently larger than those
active committing to Hudson on a daily or weekly basis, without naming names or
citing specific contributions.</p>

<p>Ted, and in turn, Oracle's approach to the Hudson community seems to stem from
a systematic misunderstanding of how most (if not all) major open source
projects operate. Mentiong closed-door meetings between Sonatype and Oracle
regarding "how to make Hudson better" do nothing to aid many developers'
concerns about Oracle's commitment to Hudson as an open source project or a
community.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, we are being told one thing while Oracle's actions speak
to another. Insisting that Hudson development remain on Java.net, after the
development community committed to GitHub, contradicts the words promising to
work with the Hudson community and to help facilitate its growth. Asserting
that Oracle isn't trying to exert unwelcome control over the project, while
doing exactly that.</p>

<p>Personally, I do want Oracle to continue to be involved, along with CloudBees,
Sonatype and many other companies that contribute to the ever-growing Hudson
ecosystem. The involvement of a plethora of different companies only helps
emphasize the importance of Hudson to the developer community and underline the
value of Hudson as a community owned and operated project.</p>

<p>December will be an interesting month, stay tuned.</p>

New Hudson Mailing Lists!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/duke-construction.gif" alt="Duke is not amused :(" align="right" />As Kohsuke <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/javanet-migration-status-update">mentioned in this post</a>, the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the Hudson community.</p>

<p>The tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine frustrating both for the core developers but <strong>hundreds</strong> of plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the planet.</p>

<p>For <strong>source code</strong> we're working on getting something in place for contributions on <a href="https://github.com/hudson/hudson">GitHub</a> thanks to some assistance from the GitHub team.</p>

<p>For <strong>mailing lists</strong> we've gone ahead and dumped Java.net mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/">hudson-dev</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/">hudson-users</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-commits/">hudson-commits</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-issues/">hudson-issues</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, you <strong>do not need a Google account</strong> to subscribe to these lists, else we wouldn't have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an email to "hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com" and you'll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.</p>

<p>Since our <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> isn't actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they <em>should</em> continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.</p>

<p>I apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we're likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.

<a href='/blog/2010/11/23/java-net-migration-status-update/'>
Java.net migration status update
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><br/>
Monday morning I came into work and discovered that I cannot commit to the Hudson Subversion repository. Initially I wasn't worried &mdash; I thought it was just another java.net outage that will resolve itself in a few hours &mdash; but a little research a bit later revealed that Hudson was locked down and being <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/communitymanager/archive/2010/11/03/javanet-begins-migration-collabnet-kenai-infrastructure">migrated to new java.net infrastructure</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I and the whole community was quite surprised by this, as we are supposed to be "notified as soon as we assign a date for [our] projects to move." But by the time the developer community noticed, the project was already locked down, repository is read-only, and mailing lists can stop functioning any time. My immediate action was to contact the folks who are doing migration to get Hudson out of this cycle of the migration, but I was told that the ship has sailed and it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Even worse, there's no ETA &mdash; it'll definitely take a week, but since this is a Thanksgiving weekend, it can take longer, Oracle said.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I find this situation plain unacceptable, and <a href="http://java.net/projects/jersey/lists/dev/archive/2010-11/message/3">e-mails from the earlier migration effort</a> made me doubt if the new infrastructure is any better. I also had a pleasure of working closely with CollabNet folks over the past years and I was also involved in some earlier conversation and experiments about the new java.net infrastructure, and when it comes to performance and monitoring, CollabNet folks really knew what they are doing. So I had multiple reasons to worry if the new infrastructure can handle the load of java.net, which the old CollabNet-hosted one couldn't handle.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
But fortunately, since the general java.net migration has been announced, we've <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Mailing-list-change-proposal-td3047548.html">discussed</a> the migration of some of the project infrastructure. So we've accelerated the plan and implemented it, so as not to lose the critical project infrastructure services.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
Hudson mailing lists are moved to Google Groups. See <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/mailing-lists">more details here</a> and <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing%20List">here</a>. The new mailing lists provide a real search capability, decent UI for archives, and it makes it easier for people with multiple e-mail addresses to post from multiple addresses and receive just one copy. The stability of the service is also much better.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Source code</h3><br/>

Hudson core source code has been long synced to GitHub. We've been getting several contributions through that already, and people have been asking <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278i20.html">for</a> <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Git-repository-for-Hudson-td394409.html#a394412">Git</a> <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/hudson-plugins-git-repository-td1477941.html">migration</a> <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Hudson-on-github-td2252960.html">for</a> <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Expose-the-Hudson-SVN-as-a-GIT-repository-td391333.html">long</a> <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/version-control-for-hudson-source-bidirectional-git-lt-gt-svn-td978706.html">time</a> anyway. So going forward I'll be committing to and producing releases from <a href="https://github.com/hudson/hudson">the Hudson repository on GitHub</a> at <tt>https://kohsuke@github.com/hudson/hudson.git</tt>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The new Git-based repository would be far snappier to work with, and it'll make it easier for people to maintain private changes and contribute changes back. There's also a work in progress to set up Gerrit to streamline the patch review process to the core. So I think this further reduces the barrier of entry to the Hudson project and accelerate the progress.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The migration of Hudson plugin repositories still needs to be discussed, so stay tuned for the updates in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev">the dev list</a> today or tomorrow. I've developed a bulk import program whose output can be seen <a href="https://github.com/HudsonLabs">here</a>, so I'm going to propose this as the migration strategy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Conclusions</h3><br/>
<p><br/>
My apologies that these changes had to happen quickly &mdash; I'm just as frustrated as you are, but given the circumstances, I think this is the best course of action. Hopefully everything will be in place within a few days. And in the mean time, thanks for your patience.<br/>

Hudson User Meet-up in Jerusalem

In tradition of taking advantages of my travel, <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/">Tikal</a>, <a href="http://www.exlibris.co.il/">ExLibris</a>, and <a href="http://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a> hosted a Hudson users meetup in Jerusalem yesterday.<br/>

There were 10+ people from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv who came over, which was great given the lack of upfront advertisement (my fault.) I did a short presentation about the current state of the Hudson project and where we are focusing efforts on. Then we had a very energetic Q&amp;A sessions that lasted like 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>

People from Tikal told me that they deploy and manage a lot of Hudson instances, so their feedbacks in the workflow/choreography/orchestration related features were very useful. And as usual, people have some positively fascinating crazy use cases &mdash; One of the participants was from a semiconductor company that builds GPU, and he said he tests their graphics cards with Hudson, which involves multiple reboots of a computer, installing software, and making sure the card doesn't produce unwanted visual artifacts!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
After the discussion, we went out for a nice dinner in a restraunt inside one of the old buildings (one of the many things Jerusalem is good at!), and by the time I got back to the hotel it was 11pm. You can see <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/alm/hudson-israeli-users-group-meetup">Ittay's take on this meetup here</a>.<br/>

One of my concerns before starting this world-wide spontaneous Hudson users meetups was if enough people show up, but I'm starting to feel comfortable now that I've done several. Hudson appears to be entrenched everywhere, and people are interested in finding out their neighbors who are using them. So stay tuned for future Hudson meetups around the world &mdash; it might be in your city!
