What is Jenkins?
</h3>
<div class='content'>
<p>
In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of plugins to support building, testing, deploying and automation

IPS Packages of Jenkins for Solaris/OpenIndiana

<p><br/>
Image Packaging System (IPS) is a new package manager Sun has developed for OpenSolaris. While I have my doubts about whether a brand-new package manager was a good way of spending engineering resources, OpenSolaris had a number of very nice features that made it a convincing platform to run Jenkins, thanks to SMF, ZFS, and zones. So I used to produce IPS packages for Jenkins. I lost the ability to do this as I left Oracle and lost access to a Solaris system, but <a href="http://www.dev-eth0.de/jenkins-continuous-integration-on-opensolaris/">a recent blog post</a> renewed my interest.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
So I'm happy to announce that the Jenkins project has started producing <a href="http://ips.jenkins-ci.org/">IPS packages for the releases</a>. With this addition, the Jekins project now produces 9 packages on different platforms (10, if you count <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jenkins-war">Ruby as a separate platform</a> :-)<br/>

2011 Donation Drive

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/tip-jar.png" align="right" /></p>

<p>Since the end of April, Jenkins has been officially part of the
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org">SPI</a> (Software
in the Public Interest), an umbrella organization which offers a useful level
of legal status for the project.</p>

<p>Up until recently we had not taken proper advantage of this new legal
umbrella, thankfully that's changed as we're now capable of <strong><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donation">accepting
donations!</a></strong></p>

<p>For the project this is a big step forward as it will allow us to offset the
cost of servers for the project, bandwidth, SSL certificates and other costs
incurred as part of running such a large open source project.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Trivia:</em> The machine that this page is being served from originally started
out as "hudson labs", purchased and colocated by

<hr />

<p><br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Since we're now able to accept donations, we're kicking off a donation drive to
help recover some of the costs incurred this summer (<a href="/content/mirror-mirror-wall">which I've discussed
previously</a>). Our immediate goal is to raise $5130
to recoup bandwidth costs, if you can spare some change, head on over to the

Jenkins Long-Term Release 1.409.2 is out
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
We just posted the updated Long-term Release (LTS) of 1.409.2.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Just as a recap, with LTS releases, we plan on providing a release train that only has backported changes. 1.409.2 contains <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-stable">a handful of important bug fixes</a> since 1.409.1. For more about LTS, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line">see this wiki page</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Thanks to the heroic effort of those who are involved, namely Vojtech Juranek and a bunch of heroes,  this release went through a rather rigorous testing, including all the automated tests we have plus <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing">a considerable number of manual eye-ball tests</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
To download, click the "Long-Term Support Release" tab from <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">the top page</a>. If you've already been using LTS, you should start receiving update notifications soon.

Call for Testers: Upcoming LTS update
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>A <a href="/content/jenkins-long-term-support-release">couple of months
ago</a> Jenkins embarked on an new project, the
Jenkins "LTS" (Long Term Support) release line. A LTS branch of development is
common in most major open source projects, especially those with substantial
corporate adoption, so this was a great step for the project as a whole.</p>

<p>We're now coming up on the second LTS release, which will be an incremental
update to the previous one (1.409.1) with only the most important fixes
back-ported to the branch.</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong> is when we need your help.</p>

<p>We need testers and interested parties from the community to help verify the
stability of the planned LTS update, 1.409.2, which is now in the release
candidate stages.</p>

<p>The testing of 1.409.2 has been spearheaded by community member <code>vjuranek</code> who
has created <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing">this <strong>fantastic test
matrix</strong></a> to
help coordinate testing of release candidates.</p>

<p>The LTS project is entirely community driven, so your input is invaluable in making
these releases successful.</p>

<p>If you're interested in helping, speak up on the <a href="/content/mailing-lists">-dev mailing
list</a> and start pitching in on the test matrix!</p>

JRuby Branch merged!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jruby.png" align="right" width="150" /> Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsrb/msg/32815b1ea917355d">announced</a> that the 'jruby' branch of jenkins-core had been <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/f6373f7ada14a7914f4ae08b6af4c1b27d343c21">merged to master</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that we're done and that you can go forth and write pure ruby plugins… not by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, what it <em>does</em> mean, is that the Jenkins mainline is much more friendly to runtime analysis of classes with which it is not familiar.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>When analyzing plugin classes, Jenkins uses just about every kind of metadata you can think of to get information about them: Class name, Field names, method names, member modifiers, annotations, you name it. It even uses the containing class relationship for inner classes to match Descriptors with what they describe.</p>

<p>It's all a great example of convention over configuration (CoC). In fact, I've never really seen CoC implemented in a Java project before as successfully as it has been in Jenkins. Plugin authors don't have to duplicate any metadata that Jenkins can figure out for you – and it's alot! The drawback though, is that extensions depend very heavily on conforming to the structure of a conventional Java class.</p>

<p>The changes in this merge, and in several of the modules on which Jenkins depends, allow more than ever to get this information by asking an object directly rather than querying its private class structure.</p>

<h2 id="the-kicker">The Kicker</h2>

<p>Many of theses changes aren't even JRuby specific! While they do enable JRuby integration, They're really just making things more friendly for dynamic languages in general. So, in theory, it should pave the way for others like JavaScript and Python.</p>

<h2 id="where-now">Where now?</h2>

<p>We're still working on the ruby runtime and tools which will provide as crisp a Ruby development experience as we can. I don't want to proffer an estimate of when those will begin to be useable, but it is important to mark this very important milestone and explain what it does and does not mean.</p>

<h3 id="we-need-you">We need you!</h3>

<p>There is still much work to be done to enable a writing Jenkins plugins in Ruby, we are looking for people who know Ruby and feel like pitching in: writing Rake tasks, improving the glue layer, documentation, etc.</p>

<p>If you're interested, most of the action is happening on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsrb">jenkinsrb@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list, so join us!</p>

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="/images/user.gif" align="right" /> We've done meetups, we've done sessions, we've done workshops, now it's about time we went ahead and did user conference don't you think?</p>

<p>Our pals over at CloudBees (Harpeet specifically) have taken the initiative in starting to organize just that: a <strong><a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference.html">Jenkins User Conference</a></strong> on <strong>October 2nd</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have your calendar at the ready, you'll notice that October 2nd is the Sunday before JavaOne kicks off this year in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The details are still coming together, but a <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference-proposed-agenda.html">proposed agenda</a> has already been posted by Harpeet.</p>

<p>As this is a community event, I'll be sure to keep the updates coming on this site but you may want to add the <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees' Blog</a> to your feed reader just in case (or just follow them on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudbees">@CloudBees</a>).</p>

Mirror, mirror on the wall
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Let me preface this entire post with this: <strong>I love
<a href="http://contegix.com">Contegix</a></strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>While working on some infrastructure tasks I had long-since put-off for the
Jenkins project, I noticed something this weekend that scared the hell out of
me.</p>

<p>At some undetermined time, our <a href="http://www.mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a>
installation <em>stopped</em> redirecting to our mirror network. Absolutely <strong>zero</strong>
downloads were being redirected, meaning that <code>cucumber</code>, the 1U machine
graciously colocated by <a href="http://www.contegix.com">Contegix</a> had served up
<strong><em>far</em></strong> more bits than I ever wanted it to.</p>

<p>As such, I would like to publicly apologize to Contegix on behalf of the
Jenkins project. Their support for the project has been tremendous but
this glitch caused such an incredible amount of traffic to be pushed through
their network that I feel exceptionally bad about it (turns out, Jenkins is pretty popular!)</p>

<p>Now, for the good news. In diagnosing and debugging this issue (in a
caffeine-fueled frenzy I might add) I managed to do a couple things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I corrected the redirection relatively easily</li>
  <li>I fixed our long-standing geo-location issue, <strong>finally enabling redirection to our european
and asian mirrors!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Within 30 minutes of correcting the error, I was able to add <em>two</em> mirrors in
Germany, re-enable one from Taiwan and add a new mirror in Japan!</p>

<!--break-->

<p>I'm hoping to add even more mirrors in even more regions as volunteers with
bandwidth step-forward, if you're interested in hosting a mirror you can drop
me a line at <code>tyler@linux.com</code>.</p>
