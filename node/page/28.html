Call for Testers: Upcoming LTS update
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>A <a href="/content/jenkins-long-term-support-release">couple of months
ago</a> Jenkins embarked on an new project, the
Jenkins "LTS" (Long Term Support) release line. A LTS branch of development is
common in most major open source projects, especially those with substantial
corporate adoption, so this was a great step for the project as a whole.</p>

<p>We're now coming up on the second LTS release, which will be an incremental
update to the previous one (1.409.1) with only the most important fixes
back-ported to the branch.</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong> is when we need your help.</p>

<p>We need testers and interested parties from the community to help verify the
stability of the planned LTS update, 1.409.2, which is now in the release
candidate stages.</p>

<p>The testing of 1.409.2 has been spearheaded by community member <code>vjuranek</code> who
has created <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing">this <strong>fantastic test
matrix</strong></a> to
help coordinate testing of release candidates.</p>

<p>The LTS project is entirely community driven, so your input is invaluable in making
these releases successful.</p>

<p>If you're interested in helping, speak up on the <a href="/content/mailing-lists">-dev mailing
list</a> and start pitching in on the test matrix!</p>

JRuby Branch merged!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/jruby.png" align="right" width="150" /> Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsrb/msg/32815b1ea917355d">announced</a> that the 'jruby' branch of jenkins-core had been <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/f6373f7ada14a7914f4ae08b6af4c1b27d343c21">merged to master</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that we're done and that you can go forth and write pure ruby plugins… not by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, what it <em>does</em> mean, is that the Jenkins mainline is much more friendly to runtime analysis of classes with which it is not familiar.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>When analyzing plugin classes, Jenkins uses just about every kind of metadata you can think of to get information about them: Class name, Field names, method names, member modifiers, annotations, you name it. It even uses the containing class relationship for inner classes to match Descriptors with what they describe.</p>

<p>It's all a great example of convention over configuration (CoC). In fact, I've never really seen CoC implemented in a Java project before as successfully as it has been in Jenkins. Plugin authors don't have to duplicate any metadata that Jenkins can figure out for you – and it's alot! The drawback though, is that extensions depend very heavily on conforming to the structure of a conventional Java class.</p>

<p>The changes in this merge, and in several of the modules on which Jenkins depends, allow more than ever to get this information by asking an object directly rather than querying its private class structure.</p>

<h2 id="the-kicker">The Kicker</h2>

<p>Many of theses changes aren't even JRuby specific! While they do enable JRuby integration, They're really just making things more friendly for dynamic languages in general. So, in theory, it should pave the way for others like JavaScript and Python.</p>

<h2 id="where-now">Where now?</h2>

<p>We're still working on the ruby runtime and tools which will provide as crisp a Ruby development experience as we can. I don't want to proffer an estimate of when those will begin to be useable, but it is important to mark this very important milestone and explain what it does and does not mean.</p>

<h3 id="we-need-you">We need you!</h3>

<p>There is still much work to be done to enable a writing Jenkins plugins in Ruby, we are looking for people who know Ruby and feel like pitching in: writing Rake tasks, improving the glue layer, documentation, etc.</p>

<p>If you're interested, most of the action is happening on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsrb">jenkinsrb@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list, so join us!</p>

<div class='content'>
<p><img src="/images/user.gif" align="right" /> We've done meetups, we've done sessions, we've done workshops, now it's about time we went ahead and did user conference don't you think?</p>

<p>Our pals over at CloudBees (Harpeet specifically) have taken the initiative in starting to organize just that: a <strong><a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference.html">Jenkins User Conference</a></strong> on <strong>October 2nd</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have your calendar at the ready, you'll notice that October 2nd is the Sunday before JavaOne kicks off this year in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The details are still coming together, but a <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference-proposed-agenda.html">proposed agenda</a> has already been posted by Harpeet.</p>

<p>As this is a community event, I'll be sure to keep the updates coming on this site but you may want to add the <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees' Blog</a> to your feed reader just in case (or just follow them on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudbees">@CloudBees</a>).</p>

Mirror, mirror on the wall
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Let me preface this entire post with this: <strong>I love
<a href="http://contegix.com">Contegix</a></strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>While working on some infrastructure tasks I had long-since put-off for the
Jenkins project, I noticed something this weekend that scared the hell out of
me.</p>

<p>At some undetermined time, our <a href="http://www.mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a>
installation <em>stopped</em> redirecting to our mirror network. Absolutely <strong>zero</strong>
downloads were being redirected, meaning that <code>cucumber</code>, the 1U machine
graciously colocated by <a href="http://www.contegix.com">Contegix</a> had served up
<strong><em>far</em></strong> more bits than I ever wanted it to.</p>

<p>As such, I would like to publicly apologize to Contegix on behalf of the
Jenkins project. Their support for the project has been tremendous but
this glitch caused such an incredible amount of traffic to be pushed through
their network that I feel exceptionally bad about it (turns out, Jenkins is pretty popular!)</p>

<p>Now, for the good news. In diagnosing and debugging this issue (in a
caffeine-fueled frenzy I might add) I managed to do a couple things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I corrected the redirection relatively easily</li>
  <li>I fixed our long-standing geo-location issue, <strong>finally enabling redirection to our european
and asian mirrors!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Within 30 minutes of correcting the error, I was able to add <em>two</em> mirrors in
Germany, re-enable one from Taiwan and add a new mirror in Japan!</p>

<!--break-->

<p>I'm hoping to add even more mirrors in even more regions as volunteers with
bandwidth step-forward, if you're interested in hosting a mirror you can drop
me a line at <code>tyler@linux.com</code>.</p>

<div class='content'>
<p>You know that the night is going to be productive whenever @kohsukekawa shows up, and last night was no exception. We talked about problems on the horizon, potential solutions, and then I spent the last half hour ripping a bit of code.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that most of the changes that have to be done to Jenkins core have already been made, so now the bulk of the heavy lifting falls to the Ruby side of things (right now, me).</p>

<p>Anyhow, on to the notes!</p>

<h2 id="attendees">Attendees</h2>

<p>@kohsukekawa, @cowboyd</p>

<h3 id="extract-more-stuff-into-the-jenkins-pluginsrb-support-library-cowboyd">extract more stuff into the jenkins-plugins.rb support library (@cowboyd)</h3>

<p>We're in the process of extracting, normalizing, documenting all the goop that's currently residing in the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-ruby-plugins-playground">ruby plugins playground</a> into a formal plugin support gem called jenkins-plugins <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb">https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb</a></p>

<h3 id="recruit-rubyists-to-implement-non-jenkins-specific-code-kohsukekawa">recruit Rubyists to implement non-Jenkins specific code (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>If you know Ruby and would like to be able to write Jenkins plugins with it, but don't know the first thing about Jenkins and/or JRuby, that's OK. You can help by implementing some of the <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb/tree/master/features">cucumber features</a> found in that repo</p>

<p>@kohsukekawa is going to be knocking on your door to ask if you're ready to step up, so I hope you've been nice this year!</p>

<h3 id="testing-strategy-cowboyd-kohsukekawa">testing strategy (@cowboyd, @kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>Ruby folk love their tests, and a plugin develompent solution won't be complete unless testing is a breeze. That means that as we extract the plugin support library, we take make sure you can test plugin classes in isolation.</p>

<p>On the Jenkins side, KK will think about how to run tests that require a full Jenkins environment. A system like this exists currently for testing java plugins, but some thought might be required on how to do this for Ruby.</p>

<h3 id="packaging-reloaded-kohsukekawa">packaging reloaded (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>KK is going to jump in and write some rake tasks to take a ruby plugin structure and package it into a valid .hpi file, and with no maven involved.  According to him, Ruby plugins aren't the only system that wants to run maven-free. There is desire to be able to do plugin development with Gradle (another Java build system), so this could be a double win.</p>

<h3 id="different-schedule-kohsukekawa">different schedule (@kohsukekawa)</h3>

<p>8:30pm Central in North America, doesn't seem to be a very good time. Especially for hackers in Asia Pacific. KK will investigate a new time that works for everybody and encourages more participation.</p>

Jenkins Long-Term Support Release
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>We have released <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">1.409.1, our first long-term support (LTS) release</a>, from the Jenkins project.</p>

<p>The idea of the LTS release is to provide a second release line the favors more stability and bug fix only maintenance. This release line branches off from a bit old Jenkins release (in this case 1.409), and we will only put important backported bug fixes. We'll keep releasing 1.409.2, 1.409.3, and so on, as such bugs appear, and in several months (our current thinking is 3 months) we'll designate another release and repeat this process all over again. I think it provides more comfortable upgrade path for larger deployments. For more about this, <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line">see Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In large companies that use Jenkins in a large scale, there often is a team of people who looks at incoming Jenkins release, tests it with their environments and their plugins, and then let their internal group consume them. With this release line, I'm calling for them to join the effort on this branch. Vojtech Juranek from Red Hat is already helping us tremendously, so is Yahoo in choosing the base release line and backporting. But it'd be great to get more people on board, as I think it'll benefit everyone to have a larger number of eyeballs on the same code. You'll also have a say on what bugs need to be backcported, etc. If you are interested in this effort, please let us know.</p>

<p>I've just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/calendar">the Jenkins calendar</a>. Conveniently, they are all events I'll be attending while traveling around Western Europe!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://jugcologne.org">The Cologne JUG</a> is having a meetup on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We'll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/jugc-jenkins-town-763587">Xing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I'll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we'll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/jenkins-treffen-munchen-30-06-2011-776226">Xing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We'll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more information and sign up at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Integration-London/events/21752121/">Meetup</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have a Jenkins event you'd like to have added to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/calendar">our calendar</a>? Let us know!</p>
